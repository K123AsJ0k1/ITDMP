	1. Chapter 1

Chapter One

I made one more valiant effort to flip the channel on the radio while my mom's eyes were focused on the road. Her hands gripped the steering wheel tightly. She had always been a nervous driver. I had almost reached the dial on the radio when she slapped my hand very quickly and tense without taking her eyes off the road.

"That music you listen to… it makes me nervous," my mother stammered as she grinded her teeth.

She doesn't usually drive, but she didn't want me driving before my appointment. She doesn't like me driving at all because of my heart condition. I've had it since I was little because of a heart transplant that went wrong. I suffered the consequences of experimental medicine. I got along alright with modern medicine and annual check-ups at the doctor. My step dad usually drove me there, but he passed away just this past year. I haven't really been affected much since we were never that close, but it really ripped the heart out of my mom, who already had an anxiety issue.

Her hands began to sweat as she reached the exit and turned on.

"Do you want anything to eat?"

"No thanks," I said. "I'm not really hungry."

"Well, I hope it doesn't affect anything at the doctors so they think I'm starving you," she was beginning to yell.

"Don't worry mom. I'll be fine," I cut her off before she got too worked up. "Really."

After many years, I had become an expert at reassuring my mother when she got anxious. She finally turned into the parking lot of the doctor's clinic. She put the car in park and let out a long, relieved breath. She wiped her hands dry and fixed her hair before we walked in.

I didn't mind the doctor's visits because they helped me to feel better, but having my mom there was, well, different. I hoped we didn't have to wait too long, only because my mom might do something embarrassing to calm herself while waiting. Don't get me wrong, unlike most sixteen-year-olds, my mom and I got along real well. I understand that the medicine she takes doesn't do enough to calm her nerves and has odd side effects, but, sometimes, it gets annoying when everyone looks our way.

Luckily, there are only a few people in the waiting room. One of them was an elderly lady, waiting with whom I assumed was her daughter and the other was an old man who has a sort of monocle on his eye and was wearing a clean pressed suit with a long coat and bowtie. He appeared to have been born in the wrong era. He was awkwardly holding a sports magazine to his face, squinting through the monocle to read the words. He peered away from his magazine to see us as we walked in and sat down, then quickly looked back at his reading.

I picked up one of the sports magazines and my mother selected one of those home decorating types. I was just finishing filling myself in on the end results of basketball games when we were ushered into a crisp room and asked to wait for the doctor.

"He'll be here in a few minutes after he finishes some paperwork," said the nurse as she closed the door behind us.

"Let me know if you need anything."

My mother thanked her as she left. There was a moment of silence before either of us spoke. My mom and I have never had trouble making conversation, but I think the small white room made her nervous. I was the one who spoke first.

"I hope I'll still be healthy enough to play basketball," I said, optimistic.

My mom smiled. "I'm sure you will honey."

Just then, Dr. Herman walked in and clicked his pen, still looking down at his clipboard. I never really like Dr. Herman. I never thought of him as a nice man. He always seemed too absorbed in his work to care much about the actual people that were his patients. Dr. Herman worked quickly. He checked my heart rate, which was ordinarily, unusual. He also checked my weight, blood pressure, took blood and urine samples, and hooked me up to a series of different heart monitors and new mechanical gadgets for various amounts of time. After a sequence of coming, asking questions, and leaving for long periods of time, Dr. Herman returned and shut the door behind him. He seemed frazzled and preoccupied as he absentmindedly leafed through the papers in his clipboard. He ran his fingers through his thin gray hair and hesitated before he spoke as if gathering his thoughts. Finally, he did speak in a hoarse tone.

"Nathan, we ran a lot of tests on you as we always do, but some of them were of a more advanced technology this time. They have helped us to understand your condition better. You seem just as healthy as ever."

The old doctor managed to form a smile as he made eye contact with us for the first time. His eyes were tired and wandered from place to place. He turned his attention towards my mom, who was staring out of the window.

"Could I go over something with Nathan privately?" He waited for a response.

My mom came to. "Huh? Oh! Sure. Yeah. I'll wait outside."

He gestured out the door. "Thank You. We'll only be a minute." The door clicked behind her.

I awkwardly shifted and fidgeted with the seam in my shirt, trying to avoid eye contact with Herman. I prepared myself for a delicately prepared speech about some nasty medical issue it was discovered I had. Dr. Herman faced me with a softened expression for the first time. _Here it comes_ , I thought to myself.

"I didn't want to worry your mother," he begins.

I sigh, thinking about how easy it was to do that.

He continues. "Your heart… has gotten weaker. The stress of a teenager's life is getting to be too much for you."

 _No kidding_.

"I have a new medicine for you to try. It's stronger than that ASTMD CARDIO stuff you were taking. It's not yet approved by the FDA, but I believe it's as safe to take as any other drug. It's passed all of its tests and trials with flying colors. It will help your heart to be stronger. We'll have a thirty-day trial and see how it goes. Tell me if you experience any side effects."

He continued with a long disclaimer about the side effects while I drifted off into my own mind.

I wasn't sure what I was daydreaming about, but whatever it was, the images were vivid and realistic. There was fire – a wall of fire. I could almost feel the heat of it when the image fizzed out like static on a radio. I turned my attention back to Dr. Herman. He was writing something down on his clipboard. I stared blankly at the walls while I waited for it all to be over. I was tired and had other things on my mind. As for my reaction to the new medicine, I could care less. I've been through many different medical procedures all my life. This was no different to me.

He handed me the sample size of this new drug. It read "CORDOCIN." I shoved it in my pocket and took my copy of immunization records or something from Dr. Herman as he opened the door and gestured out, still looking down at his clipboard. I rolled my eyes at this. My mom was waiting out in the waiting room, watching the clock and tapping her finger on the arm of the chair. A relieved smile grew on her face when I walked in.

"What happened?" she asked, happier to see me alright than concerned about anything else.

"Oh, Dr. Herman just switched my medicine. I'll be just fine," I replied in as much as a cheery voice as I could muster.

I held her arm as we left the office and thanked the receptionist. I asked my mom if she wanted me to drive, but she insisted that she was much more comfortable driving and her anxiety medication was kicking in. I gave in to her persuasions and got in the passenger side of the worn Oldsmobile. She was no longer shaking when she turned the key and relaxed as she put the car in drive and pulled out onto the street. Her calm assured attitude gave me the security to take a greatly needed nap.

When I awoke, from some strange dream, I was surprised to find that we were still on the road. It had gotten dark out and the traffic was heavier. That's where we were – stuck in a massive traffic jam. My mom was sipping some bottled water and excessively washing the windshield. I convinced her to turn on the radio to find out about the jam on the traffic report. The radio fuzzed as we tuned in. The image of the wall of fire flashed in my mind quickly. It made me feel dizzy.

When the traffic report came on, we were informed that a large oil truck had malfunctioned in the middle of the road and was leaking oil. The police were cautiously directing traffic by allowing one car at a time to slowly drive around the scene. We both realized this was going to be a long wait. I looked at the clock; it was 7:30 PM. I started calculating, using some estimation and realized that I would be up until about 1:00 AM doing homework at this rate. My heart skipped a precious beat when I remembered that I'd told Alex I would meet her at 8:00 to study for our major math test tomorrow. I became angry at the traffic jam and tried to find someone to blame, but I couldn't. That's why they're called accidents.

Alex and I had been friends since childhood. We grew up with each other and are still best friends to this day. There were always those rumors that she was my girlfriend, but people got bored of that when they realized we really were just friends. Besides, Alex and I knew too many secrets about each other to be together or anything like that.

I realized that I had no choice, but to let her down, so I whipped out my phone and told her about the whole mess. She replied soon after.

" _man! Hoping 2 copy ur notes 4 2nd section!"_

I apologized for the whole thing and tried to think of ways to help with the notes problem. I decided I'd try to explain it over the phone. She tries sending a text of the problem, but it takes a while for me to figure out exactly what it is. At first, I thought it was a dog. (I didn't tell her that because she actually would have been offended.) Eventually, I end up calling her to explain it.

Me: "So you take the log of that and put it in the logarithmic form or whatever."

Alex: "Oh. Yeah. Would you put the one, like, um, the exponent, x+2, does that go in front of it or behind?"

Me: "In front. And the five on the bottom becomes the exponent."

Alex: "Oh! Yeah. And then I get the ones with the x's on the one side and…divide…."

 _There was some silence while she calculated._

Alex: "Yay! K thanks, bud. I get it. Sorry about the traffic jam."

Me: "Yeah. Sorry I couldn't make it. Later."

Alex: "Later."

I shoved the phone back in my pocket and looked over at my mom. She looked exhausted and I could understand that. I held her hand and we sat there, tired, wishing we were home and we could end the day, but it was peaceful and, somehow, we were happy.

I turned to look at my mother's face, about to say something, but the words were dramatically jammed in my throat as the blue truck leapt from the hill. The truck was suspended in the air for what seemed like hours as my mom slowly turned her head and saw the horror unfolding before us. Her beautiful smile turned into a horrified expression. Feelings swelled up and stopped short for there was no time for feeling as the rusty blue truck came hurling down from the sky, but I did react. I shoved the door open and swung my legs out as I grabbed for my mom's shaking hand, but it slipped out as the truck crashed down and rolled onto the Oldsmobile. The great force hurled me out of the car. Shards of glass shattered all around me. People who weren't even affected screamed and ran in hysteria.

I tried to scream as I saw the Oldsmobile, my mother inside, erupt in flames in a wall of fire. Everything froze. The truck stopped rolling, the flames stopped growing, and then, just like the image of fire in my mind, the scene before my eyes fuzzed like an old television losing reception and the world moved again. It only froze for a few seconds and I barely noticed at the time because other things were more important, more distressing.

I knew, somehow, I'd have to save my mom. That was all I could think about. I just couldn't lose a third parent, so I ran into the flames in all my mass confusion and reached again for my mother's hand and jammed my foot in the buckle to set her free. Fire filled the little car as I used all of my strength to pull her free out of the car. She was limp and burned all over. She appeared helpless and lifeless. I cradled her in my arms and rocked her like she used to do to me. I brushed the hair from her red face. I thought I might have cried, but I remembered that I hadn't cried since eight years ago when my dad left. I wanted to cry. I wanted to tell her that I loved her, that she wasn't gonna die, that everything was gonna be okay. But my mom and I never needed words to say how we felt. We'd been through everything together. Somehow, we always knew what the other wanted to say without saying it.

The sound of approaching sirens grew louder as all sorts of officials arrived. The fire department got to work extinguishing the fire as we waited for the ambulance to arrive. Suddenly, it was just us two. The world around us was silent and all I could hear was my own heartbeat and my mother's faint breath. I couldn't bear the thought of losing her. She was all I had left in the world.

The next thing I heard was a medic, trying to coax me to let go of my mother. I looked up at the man, my world in a blur.

"Don't worry, son," he said. "We're gonna help your mom."

I let go, but I refused to leave her side. I ignored the requests of officials and refused to answer any questions with my silence. I remained by my mom's side in the ambulance, motionless, expressionless as medics and police buzzed around, trying to save my mom.

I knew whatever I did couldn't help her, but I clung to the bars on her stretcher anyway. The medics got her a bed when they arrived and began running quickly, pushing her to the desired location. I clung to the bed, praying she would be okay. They were shouting orders to each other, but none of it affected me in any way. I followed her all the way to the hospital room where one of the younger doctors gently grabbed my shoulder. This contact startled me and I looked at him with surprise and fear, as if she was some sort of monster. He gave me a sympathetic look.

"I'm real sorry, but you need to leave now, son."

I looked up at him and I knew he was right. I realized that I'd had such a firm grip on the bar of the bed that my hands were stuck to the metal. I peeled myself away, slowly backing away from my mom, watching as the doctors worked frantically to help my mom. I stayed long enough to see them pull the sheet over her face. I felt myself suffocate, then hit the floor.

Chapter Two

I woke up in a warm bed, my whole body aching. At first, the events of the previous day seemed to have been erased from my mind, but after only seconds, they came rushing through my head, the horror replaying itself. I got sick to my stomach and very dizzy, but I had no way to express how I felt. I just sat there as the terrible events ripped through my head over and over. I just lay back down and tried not to think about it.

I looked at the clock next to me. It was 3:15 P.M. I would have just been coming home from school now if none of this had happened. If none of this had happened – I didn't even want to consider such a concept. I realized that I had missed the calculus test today. I was wondering how Alex did when I heard a knock on my door.

"Come in," I said, questioningly.

I wondered who it could be as I realized I had no one left in the world. Alex walked in, carrying her backpack and a brown sack of what I assumed and hoped was food. She dropped her backpack down and it landed with a thud. She handed me the sack of food and I took it, gratefully. I realized how hungry I was and began to viciously scarf down the sandwich. I paused as I thought of what questions I would ask first, but Alex was the one to ask the first question.

"Do you wanna know what I got on my calc test?"

"Shoot," I said, happy for a rather neutral subject to discuss.

"Ninety-five," she said, pleased with herself.

"No way!" I exclaimed through a mouthful of sandwich. "Nice."

"Don't worry," Alex told me. "Mr. Crawson said he'd let you make it up tomorrow."

I smiled, grateful for a chance of compassion from the dreaded Mr. Crawson. I polished off the food in the sack as she filled me in on the latest Monday gossip from school. She only followed the stuff because she felt she had to, so she stuck to the basics.

"Oh. And Gina's with Garret now," she told me as she cautiously looked up from her hands at me.

I basically shrugged it off. "Yeah. I figured she didn't really care. She just needs someone to be her slave," I said indifferently.

Gina is my ex-girlfriend. She broke up with me, but I never liked her in the first place. I felt guilty that I never really cared about her, but, as it turns out, she never cared about me either. Alex always said I was too nice to her and I always let her take advantage of me. She was right after all. I had a tendency of doing that. I just kind of did whatever she wanted me to. I was rather relieved when she finally broke up with me. I never had the guts to break up with someone I never even liked.

"I'm glad you finally realize that," Alex said, relieved.

She always wanted me to break up with Gina because she knew I didn't like her.

"You know, I never really liked her," I told Alex. "I was only her boyfriend because she forced me to."

"I believe you," Alex said.

"Yeah. I just felt like I should tell you," I told her.

"Okay. Hey! I got you something," she said as she turned to get whatever it was.

"Alex," I started. "What's gonna happen to me?"

She stopped reaching for the object.

"That's what I was going to tell you…"

She paused as she lifted out a large box.

"…After I gave you this!"

She landed the heavy box on the bed and had a huge smile on her face. The box started moving and I looked at her. I opened the box to find two brown eyes staring up at me with his tongue lolling out.

"A puppy?" I asked her. "What am I gonna do with this?"

"I thought it might cheer you up," she said. "Don't worry. I'll keep him at my house until you get…settled in."

"Alex," I said slowly with a hint of suspicion in my voice. "just tell me what's gonna happen to me."

"Huh."

She sighed as she gave in and slowly dropped her smile into a more serious expression.

"You're moving in with your aunt," she said, feeling defeated.

I frowned at this statement as Alex fiddled with her hands and pet the puppy.

"Uh. Alex…I don't have an aunt. Well, that's alive anyway," I tell her.

"Oh. Yeah you do, but your mother and she didn't get along too well, so you never met her."

Alex smiled at the fact that she knew something I didn't. I stared at her and then looked at my hands. My head hurt.

"Great. So why are you telling me this and not some child control somethin' or another," I ask, truly curious how she found all this out.

"Oh. Some guy was gonna tell you, but I got nosey."

She smiled, pleased with herself.

As if the puppy got bored of the conversation, he leaped out of the box and on to my stomach, reminding me of the terrible pain in my ribs. I mulled the news over in my head. I had an aunt that I didn't know, and now she was going to be my legal guardian.

Suddenly, I was annoyed with being at Alex's house. I wanted to go home. I wanted everything to go back to the way it was nine years ago with my dad and my mom and me having nothing to worry about. I feel my gut twisting with emotion, but my face doesn't show it. In fact, my expression is more bored or tired. I decide I can't take it anymore, so I calmly got up, thanked Alex and left. It is a painful ordeal, but I do my best to appear comfortable.

I don't really know where to go. I don't think I can bear going back to my house, that is if it still is my house. I couldn't take seeing all the memories in it. I'm glad that Alex hasn't followed me. I want to be alone.

I decide to go to my favorite place. It is a tree house back in the woods behind my house. I went there all the time with my dad when he was still here. We built it together before he went to jail for a felony of manslaughter. I was so distraught because I never knew my dad was that kind of person. It ruined me.

I begin the painful journey to the tree house. I haven't been there in so long. I feel my headache coming on stronger and the blazing sun is hot on my back. My hair clings to my aching head and my ribs are trying their hardest to keep my heart from falling right out of my chest. I shove my hands in my pockets and shuffle the leaves around me.

I try to think of anything but the accident, but all of my efforts are in vain. A sadness so deep seizes my body and I feel so heavy that it takes every effort to lift my feet of the ground. I end up just dragging them behind me. Eventually, I give in, sit down on the ground, and put my head between my knees. If my heartbeat went any slower, I think it might just stop altogether. I feel like I should cry. I would let the tears stream down my face until my body ran dry, but no tears come. The pain in my ribs burns and I feel like the pull of gravity is stronger than a black hole. Instead of crying, I just close my eyes, with the images of the crash painfully flashing through my head.

I feel myself drifting off, but the pain of the images doesn't regress. I feel the heat of the fire so hot as if it is real. I begin to doubt what's real and what's not. The memory hurts like a real physical pain. I can see the car being surrounded by the perilous, burning flames. The searing metal is so close and so real. I am terrified for what must come next, but I can't seem to stop the memory from coming. I see my mom burning in the car, gasping for air and losing consciousness. The memory hurts. I feel like I am still there. I reach out to save her, but she's getting smaller and farther away. My body convulses as I try desperately to save her from the evil car, but I can't reach her. I scream as the image fizzes out and the noise is painful in my head. My consciousness returns to me, although I desperately don't want it to. I want to save my mom, but reality insists on coming to me. I find myself shaking and sweating feverously in the leaves. Now I really want to cry to shake the memory, but still I can't. I wonder about what has just happened. It seemed more than a recollection. It was like I had physically returned to the crash. My head spins and my sweaty body continues to shake violently. I end up losing the wonderful sandwich in my stomach and I roll over and bury my face in the leaves.

The fog lifts from my eyes and I see two, maybe three pairs of feet shuffling in the leaves from a distance. I can faintly hear voices. I remember the ordeal I had been through by the pain and soreness that consumes me now. I recognize one of the voices as Alex, but the others are unfamiliar. They are the voices of loud, grown men and they are walking towards me. The men walk heavily and crush the leaves as they approach. I don't recognize them at all. I realize the group is speaking in panicked tones and are running towards my crumpled form. Alex reaches me first, eyes wide with fear.

"Are you okay, Nathan? Can you hear me? Talk to me! Talk to me!"

She is screaming at my dazed face, and I am distressed that she seems so worried. I wrench my face from her hands and try and take in the situation.

"I'm fine, Alex. I was just taking a nap," I reassure her almost like I did my mother.

The larger of the two men steps in. His voice is low and loud.

"I'm Butch Muldoon from the Child Protective Services Agency. Your friend here told us where to find you. We have come to take you to your aunt's house. You come with us now," he said in short, to-the-point sentences.

Butch wasn't a man I would trust with placing children in proper homes. He was intimidating and his expression was hard and uninviting. He was tall and wore a clean suit. The man that was with him was smaller, but much older. I judged him as the type to follow orders and be manipulated and was most likely the larger man's assistant of sorts.

"Come on now, son," the smaller man said to me when I didn't immediately respond.

I realize my condition must appear quite horrific, so I painfully roll myself up to shake the man's hand. I wipe my sweating hand on my shirt before offering it to Butch. He takes it, but lightly, as if it was the most disgusting thing he had ever touched.

"Nathan," I say, finally deciding to introduce myself.

"Yes, we know," Butch responds.

I thought him rather arrogant and everything that came out of his mouth only confirmed my thoughts.

"Come on Nathan. Let's go get your things now," the old man behind him says to me as he gently guides me back to the house.

I didn't know what to expect when I walked into my house for the first time since the accident. I walked in the door with Butch and the old man breathing down my neck. The place seemed cold and empty. There was an air of loneliness in the air as I slowly walked in to the room that my mom and I had just eaten only yesterday. I swallow hard as I slowly make my way to the stairs.

"We best get movin' on. The day's a wastin' and I got a sandwich back in the office with my name on it," Butch says as if this is just another stop in his workday.

I really hated his arrogant tone, but I didn't acknowledge what he said. I sighed as I walked up to my room to get my things. Thankfully, Butch and his friend decided to stay downstairs and carry on a meaningless conversation. My room was just the way I left it before that doctor's appointment. I started to pack all of my things. I didn't really have too many things. With all that my family had been through, we never really had too much money to buy expensive things, nor did we feel the need for them. I ended up taking all my clothes and some pictures. I also took a baseball that my dad and I used to play catch with and a journal my mom got me. I never wrote in it, but I kept it anyway.

All of my belongings fit in my backpack, a small travel bag, and cardboard box. I went into my mom's room with all my belongings and I decided to take the stress ball she always used to calm herself down. I don't know how many times she crushed that thing between her fist, breathing slowly when she got excited. I had everything I had left of a family on my back or in my hands.

I took a minute to ponder what life with my unknown aunt would be like. I would leave my life behind to go and live with someone I had never met. How many things would change? What would she be like? Would she hate me like she hated my mother?

The conversation downstairs had dwindled, so I assumed they were waiting up for me. I clamored downstairs with a heavy heart. I wasn't looking forward to having any such conversation with Butch and his friend, so I hoped he would understand my facial expression that I didn't want to talk. I doubted that type of understanding from the cold man.

To my surprise, I found Alex standing there, holding the puppy. I hadn't noticed that she had left before. I guess she left somewhere between the woods and my house, went home, and got the puppy. I don't know why. I couldn't take him with me.


	2. Chapter 2 and 3

Chapter One

I made one more valiant effort to flip the channel on the radio while my mom's eyes were focused on the road. Her hands gripped the steering wheel tightly. She had always been a nervous driver. I had almost reached the dial on the radio when she slapped my hand very quickly and tense without taking her eyes off the road.

"That music you listen to… it makes me nervous," my mother stammered as she grinded her teeth.

She doesn't usually drive, but she didn't want me driving before my appointment. She doesn't like me driving at all because of my heart condition.

I haven't really been affected much since we were never that close, but it really ripped the heart out of my mom, who already had an anxiety issue.

Her hands began to sweat as she reached the exit and turned on.

"Do you want anything to eat?"

"No thanks," I said. "I'm not really hungry."

"Well, I hope it doesn't affect anything at the doctors so they think I'm starving you," she was beginning to yell.

"Don't worry mom. I'll be fine," I cut her off before she got too worked up. "Really."

After many years, I had become an expert at reassuring my mother when she got anxious. She finally turned into the parking lot of the doctor's clinic. She put the car in park and let out a long, relieved breath. She wiped her hands dry and fixed her hair before we walked in.

I didn't mind the doctor's visits because they helped me to feel better, but having my mom there was, well, different. I hoped we didn't have to wait too long, only because my mom might do something embarrassing to calm herself while waiting. Don't get me wrong, unlike most sixteen-year-olds, my mom and I got along real well. I understand that the medicine she takes doesn't do enough to calm her nerves and has odd side effects, but, sometimes, it gets annoying when everyone looks our way.

Luckily, there are only a few people in the waiting room. One of them was an elderly lady, waiting with whom I assumed was her daughter and the other was an old man who has a sort of monocle on his eye and was wearing a clean pressed suit with a long coat and bowtie. He appeared to have been born in the wrong era. He was awkwardly holding a sports magazine to his face, squinting through the monocle to read the words. He peered away from his magazine to see us as we walked in and sat down, then quickly looked back at his reading.

I picked up one of the sports magazines and my mother selected one of those home decorating types. I was just finishing filling myself in on the end results of basketball games when we were ushered into a crisp room and asked to wait for the doctor.

"He'll be here in a few minutes after he finishes some paperwork," said the nurse as she closed the door behind us.

"Let me know if you need anything."

My mother thanked her as she left. There was a moment of silence before either of us spoke. My mom and I have never had trouble making conversation, but I think the small white room made her nervous. I was the one who spoke first.

"I hope I'll still be healthy enough to play basketball," I said, optimistic.

My mom smiled. "I'm sure you will honey."

Just then, Dr. Herman walked in and clicked his pen, still looking down at his clipboard. I never really like Dr. Herman. I never thought of him as a nice man. He always seemed too absorbed in his work to care much about the actual people that were his patients. Dr. Herman worked quickly. He checked my heart rate, which was ordinarily, unusual. He also checked my weight, blood pressure, took blood and urine samples, and hooked me up to a series of different heart monitors and new mechanical gadgets for various amounts of time. After a sequence of coming, asking questions, and leaving for long periods of time, Dr. Herman returned and shut the door behind him. He seemed frazzled and preoccupied as he absentmindedly leafed through the papers in his clipboard. He ran his fingers through his thin gray hair and hesitated before he spoke as if gathering his thoughts. Finally, he did speak in a hoarse tone.

"Nathan, we ran a lot of tests on you as we always do, but some of them were of a more advanced technology this time. They have helped us to understand your condition better. You seem just as healthy as ever."

The old doctor managed to form a smile as he made eye contact with us for the first time. His eyes were tired and wandered from place to place. He turned his attention towards my mom, who was staring out of the window.

"Could I go over something with Nathan privately?" He waited for a response.

My mom came to. "Huh? Oh! Sure. Yeah. I'll wait outside."

He gestured out the door. "Thank You. We'll only be a minute." The door clicked behind her.

I awkwardly shifted and fidgeted with the seam in my shirt, trying to avoid eye contact with Herman. I prepared myself for a delicately prepared speech about some nasty medical issue it was discovered I had. Dr. Herman faced me with a softened expression for the first time. _Here it comes_ , I thought to myself.

"I didn't want to worry your mother," he begins.

I sigh, thinking about how easy it was to do that.

He continues. "Your heart… has gotten weaker. The stress of a teenager's life is getting to be too much for you."

 _No kidding_.

"I have a new medicine for you to try. It's stronger than that ASTMD CARDIO stuff you were taking. It's not yet approved by the FDA, but I believe it's as safe to take as any other drug. It's passed all of its tests and trials with flying colors. It will help your heart to be stronger. We'll have a thirty-day trial and see how it goes. Tell me if you experience any side effects."

He continued with a long disclaimer about the side effects while I drifted off into my own mind.

I wasn't sure what I was daydreaming about, but whatever it was, the images were vivid and realistic. There was fire – a wall of fire. I could almost feel the heat of it when the image fizzed out like static on a radio. I turned my attention back to Dr. Herman. He was writing something down on his clipboard. I stared blankly at the walls while I waited for it all to be over. I was tired and had other things on my mind. As for my reaction to the new medicine, I could care less. I've been through many different medical procedures all my life. This was no different to me.

He handed me the sample size of this new drug. It read "CORDOCIN." I shoved it in my pocket and took my copy of immunization records or something from Dr. Herman as he opened the door and gestured out, still looking down at his clipboard. I rolled my eyes at this. My mom was waiting out in the waiting room, watching the clock and tapping her finger on the arm of the chair. A relieved smile grew on her face when I walked in.

"What happened?" she asked, happier to see me alright than concerned about anything else.

"Oh, Dr. Herman just switched my medicine. I'll be just fine," I replied in as much as a cheery voice as I could muster.

I held her arm as we left the office and thanked the receptionist. I asked my mom if she wanted me to drive, but she insisted that she was much more comfortable driving and her anxiety medication was kicking in. I gave in to her persuasions and got in the passenger side of the worn Oldsmobile. She was no longer shaking when she turned the key and relaxed as she put the car in drive and pulled out onto the street. Her calm assured attitude gave me the security to take a greatly needed nap.

When I awoke, from some strange dream, I was surprised to find that we were still on the road. It had gotten dark out and the traffic was heavier. That's where we were – stuck in a massive traffic jam. My mom was sipping some bottled water and excessively washing the windshield. I convinced her to turn on the radio to find out about the jam on the traffic report. The radio fuzzed as we tuned in. The image of the wall of fire flashed in my mind quickly. It made me feel dizzy.

When the traffic report came on, we were informed that a large oil truck had malfunctioned in the middle of the road and was leaking oil. The police were cautiously directing traffic by allowing one car at a time to slowly drive around the scene. We both realized this was going to be a long wait. I looked at the clock; it was 7:30 PM. I started calculating, using some estimation and realized that I would be up until about 1:00 AM doing homework at this rate. My heart skipped a precious beat when I remembered that I'd told Alex I would meet her at 8:00 to study for our major math test tomorrow. I became angry at the traffic jam and tried to find someone to blame, but I couldn't. That's why they're called accidents.

Alex and I had been friends since childhood. We grew up with each other and are still best friends to this day. There were always those rumors that she was my girlfriend, but people got bored of that when they realized we really were just friends. Besides, Alex and I knew too many secrets about each other to be together or anything like that.

I realized that I had no choice, but to let her down, so I whipped out my phone and told her about the whole mess. She replied soon after.

" _man! Hoping 2 copy ur notes 4 2nd section!"_

I apologized for the whole thing and tried to think of ways to help with the notes problem. I decided I'd try to explain it over the phone. She tries sending a text of the problem, but it takes a while for me to figure out exactly what it is. At first, I thought it was a dog. (I didn't tell her that because she actually would have been offended.) Eventually, I end up calling her to explain it.

Me: "So you take the log of that and put it in the logarithmic form or whatever."

Alex: "Oh. Yeah. Would you put the one, like, um, the exponent, x+2, does that go in front of it or behind?"

Me: "In front. And the five on the bottom becomes the exponent."

Alex: "Oh! Yeah. And then I get the ones with the x's on the one side and…divide…."

 _There was some silence while she calculated._

Alex: "Yay! K thanks, bud. I get it. Sorry about the traffic jam."

Me: "Yeah. Sorry I couldn't make it. Later."

Alex: "Later."

I shoved the phone back in my pocket and looked over at my mom. She looked exhausted and I could understand that. I held her hand and we sat there, tired, wishing we were home and we could end the day, but it was peaceful and, somehow, we were happy.

I turned to look at my mother's face, about to say something, but the words were dramatically jammed in my throat as the blue truck leapt from the hill. The truck was suspended in the air for what seemed like hours as my mom slowly turned her head and saw the horror unfolding before us. Her beautiful smile turned into a horrified expression. Feelings swelled up and stopped short for there was no time for feeling as the rusty blue truck came hurling down from the sky, but I did react. I shoved the door open and swung my legs out as I grabbed for my mom's shaking hand, but it slipped out as the truck crashed down and rolled onto the Oldsmobile. The great force hurled me out of the car. Shards of glass shattered all around me. People who weren't even affected screamed and ran in hysteria.

I tried to scream as I saw the Oldsmobile, my mother inside, erupt in flames in a wall of fire. Everything froze. The truck stopped rolling, the flames stopped growing, and then, just like the image of fire in my mind, the scene before my eyes fuzzed like an old television losing reception and the world moved again. It only froze for a few seconds and I barely noticed at the time because other things were more important, more distressing.

I knew, somehow, I'd have to save my mom. That was all I could think about. I just couldn't lose a third parent, so I ran into the flames in all my mass confusion and reached again for my mother's hand and jammed my foot in the buckle to set her free. Fire filled the little car as I used all of my strength to pull her free out of the car. She was limp and burned all over. She appeared helpless and lifeless. I cradled her in my arms and rocked her like she used to do to me. I brushed the hair from her red face. I thought I might have cried, but I remembered that I hadn't cried since eight years ago when my dad left. I wanted to cry. I wanted to tell her that I loved her, that she wasn't gonna die, that everything was gonna be okay. But my mom and I never needed words to say how we felt. We'd been through everything together. Somehow, we always knew what the other wanted to say without saying it.

The sound of approaching sirens grew louder as all sorts of officials arrived. The fire department got to work extinguishing the fire as we waited for the ambulance to arrive. Suddenly, it was just us two. The world around us was silent and all I could hear was my own heartbeat and my mother's faint breath. I couldn't bear the thought of losing her. She was all I had left in the world.

The next thing I heard was a medic, trying to coax me to let go of my mother. I looked up at the man, my world in a blur.

"Don't worry, son," he said. "We're gonna help your mom."

I let go, but I refused to leave her side. I ignored the requests of officials and refused to answer any questions with my silence. I remained by my mom's side in the ambulance, motionless, expressionless as medics and police buzzed around, trying to save my mom.

I knew whatever I did couldn't help her, but I clung to the bars on her stretcher anyway. The medics got her a bed when they arrived and began running quickly, pushing her to the desired location. I clung to the bed, praying she would be okay. They were shouting orders to each other, but none of it affected me in any way. I followed her all the way to the hospital room where one of the younger doctors gently grabbed my shoulder. This contact startled me and I looked at him with surprise and fear, as if she was some sort of monster. He gave me a sympathetic look.

"I'm real sorry, but you need to leave now, son."

I looked up at him and I knew he was right. I realized that I'd had such a firm grip on the bar of the bed that my hands were stuck to the metal. I peeled myself away, slowly backing away from my mom, watching as the doctors worked frantically to help my mom. I stayed long enough to see them pull the sheet over her face. I felt myself suffocate, then hit the floor.

Chapter Two

I woke up in a warm bed, my whole body aching. At first, the events of the previous day seemed to have been erased from my mind, but after only seconds, they came rushing through my head, the horror replaying itself. I got sick to my stomach and very dizzy, but I had no way to express how I felt. I just sat there as the terrible events ripped through my head over and over. I just lay back down and tried not to think about it.

I looked at the clock next to me. It was 3:15 P.M. I would have just been coming home from school now if none of this had happened. If none of this had happened – I didn't even want to consider such a concept. I realized that I had missed the calculus test today. I was wondering how Alex did when I heard a knock on my door.

"Come in," I said, questioningly.

I wondered who it could be as I realized I had no one left in the world. Alex walked in, carrying her backpack and a brown sack of what I assumed and hoped was food. She dropped her backpack down and it landed with a thud. She handed me the sack of food and I took it, gratefully. I realized how hungry I was and began to viciously scarf down the sandwich. I paused as I thought of what questions I would ask first, but Alex was the one to ask the first question.

"Do you wanna know what I got on my calc test?"

"Shoot," I said, happy for a rather neutral subject to discuss.

"Ninety-five," she said, pleased with herself.

"No way!" I exclaimed through a mouthful of sandwich. "Nice."

"Don't worry," Alex told me. "Mr. Crawson said he'd let you make it up tomorrow."

I smiled, grateful for a chance of compassion from the dreaded Mr. Crawson. I polished off the food in the sack as she filled me in on the latest Monday gossip from school. She only followed the stuff because she felt she had to, so she stuck to the basics.

"Oh. And Gina's with Garret now," she told me as she cautiously looked up from her hands at me.

I basically shrugged it off. "Yeah. I figured she didn't really care. She just needs someone to be her slave," I said indifferently.

Gina is my ex-girlfriend. She broke up with me, but I never liked her in the first place. I felt guilty that I never really cared about her, but, as it turns out, she never cared about me either. Alex always said I was too nice to her and I always let her take advantage of me. She was right after all. I had a tendency of doing that. I just kind of did whatever she wanted me to. I was rather relieved when she finally broke up with me. I never had the guts to break up with someone I never even liked.

"I'm glad you finally realize that," Alex said, relieved.

She always wanted me to break up with Gina because she knew I didn't like her.

"You know, I never really liked her," I told Alex. "I was only her boyfriend because she forced me to."

"I believe you," Alex said.

"Yeah. I just felt like I should tell you," I told her.

"Okay. Hey! I got you something," she said as she turned to get whatever it was.

"Alex," I started. "What's gonna happen to me?"

She stopped reaching for the object.

"That's what I was going to tell you…"

She paused as she lifted out a large box.

"…After I gave you this!"

She landed the heavy box on the bed and had a huge smile on her face. The box started moving and I looked at her. I opened the box to find two brown eyes staring up at me with his tongue lolling out.

"A puppy?" I asked her. "What am I gonna do with this?"

"I thought it might cheer you up," she said. "Don't worry. I'll keep him at my house until you get…settled in."

"Alex," I said slowly with a hint of suspicion in my voice. "just tell me what's gonna happen to me."

"Huh."

She sighed as she gave in and slowly dropped her smile into a more serious expression.

"You're moving in with your aunt," she said, feeling defeated.

I frowned at this statement as Alex fiddled with her hands and pet the puppy.

"Uh. Alex…I don't have an aunt. Well, that's alive anyway," I tell her.

"Oh. Yeah you do, but your mother and she didn't get along too well, so you never met her."

Alex smiled at the fact that she knew something I didn't. I stared at her and then looked at my hands. My head hurt.

"Great. So why are you telling me this and not some child control somethin' or another," I ask, truly curious how she found all this out.

"Oh. Some guy was gonna tell you, but I got nosey."

She smiled, pleased with herself.

As if the puppy got bored of the conversation, he leaped out of the box and on to my stomach, reminding me of the terrible pain in my ribs. I mulled the news over in my head. I had an aunt that I didn't know, and now she was going to be my legal guardian.

Suddenly, I was annoyed with being at Alex's house. I wanted to go home. I wanted everything to go back to the way it was nine years ago with my dad and my mom and me having nothing to worry about. I feel my gut twisting with emotion, but my face doesn't show it. In fact, my expression is more bored or tired. I decide I can't take it anymore, so I calmly got up, thanked Alex and left. It is a painful ordeal, but I do my best to appear comfortable.

I don't really know where to go. I don't think I can bear going back to my house, that is if it still is my house. I couldn't take seeing all the memories in it. I'm glad that Alex hasn't followed me. I want to be alone.

I decide to go to my favorite place. It is a tree house back in the woods behind my house. I went there all the time with my dad when he was still here. We built it together before he went to jail for a felony of manslaughter. I was so distraught because I never knew my dad was that kind of person. It ruined me.

I begin the painful journey to the tree house. I haven't been there in so long. I feel my headache coming on stronger and the blazing sun is hot on my back. My hair clings to my aching head and my ribs are trying their hardest to keep my heart from falling right out of my chest. I shove my hands in my pockets and shuffle the leaves around me.

I try to think of anything but the accident, but all of my efforts are in vain. A sadness so deep seizes my body and I feel so heavy that it takes every effort to lift my feet of the ground. I end up just dragging them behind me. Eventually, I give in, sit down on the ground, and put my head between my knees. If my heartbeat went any slower, I think it might just stop altogether. I feel like I should cry. I would let the tears stream down my face until my body ran dry, but no tears come. The pain in my ribs burns and I feel like the pull of gravity is stronger than a black hole. Instead of crying, I just close my eyes, with the images of the crash painfully flashing through my head.

I feel myself drifting off, but the pain of the images doesn't regress. I feel the heat of the fire so hot as if it is real. I begin to doubt what's real and what's not. The memory hurts like a real physical pain. I can see the car being surrounded by the perilous, burning flames. The searing metal is so close and so real. I am terrified for what must come next, but I can't seem to stop the memory from coming. I see my mom burning in the car, gasping for air and losing consciousness. The memory hurts. I feel like I am still there. I reach out to save her, but she's getting smaller and farther away. My body convulses as I try desperately to save her from the evil car, but I can't reach her. I scream as the image fizzes out and the noise is painful in my head. My consciousness returns to me, although I desperately don't want it to. I want to save my mom, but reality insists on coming to me. I find myself shaking and sweating feverously in the leaves. Now I really want to cry to shake the memory, but still I can't. I wonder about what has just happened. It seemed more than a recollection. It was like I had physically returned to the crash. My head spins and my sweaty body continues to shake violently. I end up losing the wonderful sandwich in my stomach and I roll over and bury my face in the leaves.

The fog lifts from my eyes and I see two, maybe three pairs of feet shuffling in the leaves from a distance. I can faintly hear voices. I remember the ordeal I had been through by the pain and soreness that consumes me now. I recognize one of the voices as Alex, but the others are unfamiliar. They are the voices of loud, grown men and they are walking towards me. The men walk heavily and crush the leaves as they approach. I don't recognize them at all. I realize the group is speaking in panicked tones and are running towards my crumpled form. Alex reaches me first, eyes wide with fear.

"Are you okay, Nathan? Can you hear me? Talk to me! Talk to me!"

She is screaming at my dazed face, and I am distressed that she seems so worried. I wrench my face from her hands and try and take in the situation.

"I'm fine, Alex. I was just taking a nap," I reassure her almost like I did my mother.

The larger of the two men steps in. His voice is low and loud.

"I'm Butch Muldoon from the Child Protective Services Agency. Your friend here told us where to find you. We have come to take you to your aunt's house. You come with us now," he said in short, to-the-point sentences.

Butch wasn't a man I would trust with placing children in proper homes. He was intimidating and his expression was hard and uninviting. He was tall and wore a clean suit. The man that was with him was smaller, but much older. I judged him as the type to follow orders and be manipulated and was most likely the larger man's assistant of sorts.

"Come on now, son," the smaller man said to me when I didn't immediately respond.

I realize my condition must appear quite horrific, so I painfully roll myself up to shake the man's hand. I wipe my sweating hand on my shirt before offering it to Butch. He takes it, but lightly, as if it was the most disgusting thing he had ever touched.

"Nathan," I say, finally deciding to introduce myself.

"Yes, we know," Butch responds.

I thought him rather arrogant and everything that came out of his mouth only confirmed my thoughts.

"Come on Nathan. Let's go get your things now," the old man behind him says to me as he gently guides me back to the house.

I didn't know what to expect when I walked into my house for the first time since the accident. I walked in the door with Butch and the old man breathing down my neck. The place seemed cold and empty. There was an air of loneliness in the air as I slowly walked in to the room that my mom and I had just eaten only yesterday. I swallow hard as I slowly make my way to the stairs.

"We best get movin' on. The day's a wastin' and I got a sandwich back in the office with my name on it," Butch says as if this is just another stop in his workday.

I really hated his arrogant tone, but I didn't acknowledge what he said. I sighed as I walked up to my room to get my things. Thankfully, Butch and his friend decided to stay downstairs and carry on a meaningless conversation. My room was just the way I left it before that doctor's appointment. I started to pack all of my things. I didn't really have too many things. With all that my family had been through, we never really had too much money to buy expensive things, nor did we feel the need for them. I ended up taking all my clothes and some pictures. I also took a baseball that my dad and I used to play catch with and a journal my mom got me. I never wrote in it, but I kept it anyway.

All of my belongings fit in my backpack, a small travel bag, and cardboard box. I went into my mom's room with all my belongings and I decided to take the stress ball she always used to calm herself down. I don't know how many times she crushed that thing between her fist, breathing slowly when she got excited. I had everything I had left of a family on my back or in my hands.

I took a minute to ponder what life with my unknown aunt would be like. I would leave my life behind to go and live with someone I had never met. How many things would change? What would she be like? Would she hate me like she hated my mother?

The conversation downstairs had dwindled, so I assumed they were waiting up for me. I clamored downstairs with a heavy heart. I wasn't looking forward to having any such conversation with Butch and his friend, so I hoped he would understand my facial expression that I didn't want to talk. I doubted that type of understanding from the cold man.

To my surprise, I found Alex standing there, holding the puppy. I hadn't noticed that she had left before. I guess she left somewhere between the woods and my house, went home, and got the puppy. I don't know why. I couldn't take him with me.

"Hurry up and say goodbye to your girlfriend. I'm eager to get going," says Butch.

I am annoyed at his comment about Alex being my girlfriend and mumble under my breath as I walk past him, "She's not my girlfriend." Butch seems unaffected by anything I say and lights up a cigarette…in my house. I have to restrain myself from punching him in the face.

The puppy wriggles furiously in Alex's arms as I walk toward them. He licks the air and sticks his paws at me like a baby wanting his mom to hold him. He is overjoyed when I pet his head and scratches at me with all of his paws. I don't really know what to say to Alex. I've never really had the chance to say goodbye to anybody. They were always gone before I had the chance. I give up on words and just hug her tightly, squishing the puppy between us.

"Don't worry. We'll still see each other at school. It's not like you're moving out of state or anything," she says.

She always had words when I didn't. I smile at her, gather my belongings, and walk to the car that waits to take me to my new home.

Chapter Three

The house is magnificent. Out of all that I imagined, I wasn't expecting this. It had two stories and beautiful windows. Even the front door was impressive.
