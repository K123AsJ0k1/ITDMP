 _Many places have their own unique legends. Like the south's tales of giant snakes and man eating plants. Or perhaps the Northern mountain tales of a hairy man like beast... Tales that travel on the wind and reach everywhere but nowhere at all... Tales…Legends…Folklore…None are really real or are they?_

 _There is a tale in a land harshly burned by hot desert sun, and scorned by the angry wind. Sand surrounds and stretches as far as the eye can see. Men and women wear dark heavy cloaks to shield themselves from the strong desert storms and yet suffer from the scalding heat._

 _In the taverns of a small poor town nestled in such an accursed place is the tale of the ruins. The ruins that were once a magnificent palace and home to a great civilization which were wise beyond belief or so the tale says. Treasure was rumored to be stowed in the depths of such a place.. But who knows for no one alive has journeyed there and returned to validate such a thing._

 _The ruins are only an old desert rumor though said to be located by a dry well which produces rainbows. Hah rainbows in a desert impossible! Yet the tale insists that the well and a graveyard are the first markers that one is going the right way to the ruins.. How this tale started no one is sure for you see, no one in this day and age has seen the ruins... Only heard of them…_

**Chapter 1: My name is Alley**

My name is Alley. I'm 9 years old well actually I'm 9 and three quarters but still Namon insists I'm 9. Namon is my caretaker she helps me and the other orphaned girls at the orphanage. We're a small group or so I'm told, only about 10 girls. When I was little I remembered there were more of us... There was Nala and Tika but they disappeared... One night they just vanished... Namon told us not to worry and claimed they'd found their parents but Gija my best friend (whose a bit younger then me) claimed she saw dark cloaked men take them away on horses as dark as night. I'm doubtful though, I mean Gija is good at weaving tales she probably made that up... She's better then me anyway at tales... I'm not good at tale weaving or lying.. When I get in trouble I can't seem to get out without Gija. She always helps me and I help her with her sewing. She's a terrible seamer. Oh as they say a seamstress. That seems like such a big word!

Anyway, I live in the small town of Garontaz. A funny word which Namon says means rock. Rock in the desert I think. Well the name sure does our town justice! There's not many plants around here... Just your occasional tumble weed or odd struggling plant. Once me and Gija found a little green prickly plant and tried to keep it alive in our room. But it died after a couple days to our sadness.

Every morning we girls get up and start the day with cleaning our rooms, sweeping them and rearranging the small shelves where we keep our greatest treasures. Gija's greatest treasure is a picture of her sister and family. She and her sister came to the orphanage when there parents died in a horrible accident. Gija never told me how they died and I daren't ask her...

My greatest treasure is a small silver star locket with a smooth blue shining stone in it. But it doesn't lie on the small shelf with the other treasures. It lies safely under my small white pillow. I found it one day when we were playing amongst the sand caves... The cave disappeared after a great sandstorm so we didn't get to explore it for more treasure.

The cave was so scary and mysterious it's like it became night! The interior was all mol moldy mysterious with soft moss and strange little white bugs which scattered if we got to close. There were strange tan white things almost hairless rats with wings! The little monsters made scary screechy sounds that made me and Gija run the first time we peeked in.

It took us 4 tries but we finally got close enough to see a small light deep in the cave. The light excited us and something about it seemed to welcome us. The little light sparkled and twinkled but no matter how much we walked it didn't seem to get any closer. Somehow I tripped and landed sprawled on the ground. By someway I fell onto something smooth and cool the light was too dim to see what it was but I felt something cold and metallic under my hand. Something like metal of the iron poker which Namon used to stir embers in the evening fire.

But the metal didn't feel rusty and rough like Namon's tool... Upon closer looking I saw it was a necklace and stuck it in my single pocket. Gija soon announced it was getting late and we'd better head back. She has a weird way of knowing when it's time to leave, for as soon as we started tracking back the cave started to rumble and the flying monsters screeched murderously. We ran for our lives screaming all the way till the desert sand greeted our eyes once again and the cool desert air wrapped its icy fingers around us. By the time we came out of the cave the moon was starting to peek.

Namon was not pleased with our late arrival and I didn't tell her about the necklace. I had a funny feeling inside me that I shouldn't tell anyone about it. I only told one person and made her pinkie swear not to tell. Nala. When Nala disappeared I got worried. Worried about her and if she would tell my secret... I often spent nights crying in my pillow silently and Gija watching on sometimes whispering small words of comfort. Those nights made me rethink me decision in telling Nala after all Gija was with me she had the right to know. But back then when I was 7, Nala was the leader of our group. Our friend. Our sister. She knew everything! What were we going to do now that she was gone? Gone like the small grains the wind tossed about... When would we become gone too! Who would go first?!

I prayed it wasn't Gija. Or me.

Part two of chapter one will be coming in but a moment! Please review and no flames! Leave a smiley if your following the story!

	3. My Name is Alley  Part 2:

Thankies for waiting here is chapter 1.3 since I accidentally titled the prologue chapter 1... ;

Again All is mine do not steal...

Recap: I prayed it wasn't Gija. Or me.

The hot sun that threatens to swallow the sky slowly ambles to its place the rays not yet permeating that air with an unbearable heat. The small town of Garontaz slowly wakes up. Some people are already up and starting the tedious work of the day. A medium sized building housing the orphans starts to wake.

Namon is already stirring everyone up from the cold desert dreams that linger vaguely. Soon I turn from the small brown framed window, the only window, in our room. By ours I mean the girls of the orphanage of course. This house is bigger compared to the others near it but it is small when you have to share it with 15 other people. There are 3 care takers and 12 girls at the present. Like I told you before there used to be more but right now our ages range from the youngest (Marie) being 6 to the oldest being 12 (Niara.) There is not much of a gap of ages when you really think about it.

Gija barely wakes when one of the other caretakers, Najila I think, pokes her head in and shouts for us to get up. I turn to watch Gija as she mumbles from under the covers and turns. A smile of mischief creeps on my face as I stalk like a coyote of the desert upon my prey.

"Roar!" I growl and then jump playfully on her startling her out of her half dreams. She screams but quickly is cut off as I put a hand onto her mouth worry starts on my face. Some voices of the other girls mutter protests as they head out of the room to the bathroom.

"Shh...Shh it's okay it's only me." I reassure her as her wild dark blue eyes dart this way and that. She has beautiful blue eyes and I used to be jealous of that when she first came her, for some odd reason that thought once again found itself in my head. I have plain brown eyes nothing really rare like the greens and the pretty blues some girls have. Slowly she focuses on me and relief floods her face. I feel a bit guilty at this and take away my hand letting it clutch my evening dress instead. The scratchy fabric rubs against my smooth tan hands.

"Alley! Alley don't scare me I thought you were one of-" She cut off as a shadow fell upon both of our own small ones. A shadow we knew well.

"Girls, what are you doing still in bed? Up, up I say or you shan't get breakfast." Namon states firmly one hand grabbing Gija's elbow and helping her stand up while I scooted back.

Namon's long shiny dark soot hair falls forward shadowing her sun kissed face for a mere moment before she impatiently sweeps it back looking at Gija sternly with her dark stern eyes. I take a moment to observe her as she is usually wrapped up in the cloak instead of in a plain dress with an white starched apron.

"Why aren't you dressed yet?" she snaps impatiently then turned to me seeing I'm in the same condition.

"Aya... you both are such trouble... Quickly go to Najila and get your clothes and change out of those gowns."

"Yes, Namon..." we both murmur quietly and hang our heads as we exit out of the room in an ashamed gesture and quickly go to the laundry room which is one of the rooms that isn't hard to find. The room that's full of noise day and night.

\---------------------- 2 hours later!-------------------------------

2 hours later or about then Gija and I were happily eating what remained of a hot breakfast. I carefully scooped the oatmeal and popped it in my mouth careful not to spill any on my day's outfit. The day outfit for most girls consist of a loose black pants with a long dark skirt on top to look "proper" and then a white shirt with a dark forest brown makeshift vest sewn by one of the leaders/caretakers. If you ruined your outfit the first day it'd be like that for three days, you wouldn't get a substitute... I learned that the hard way.

I glanced across the nearly empty table to see Gija simply stirring her oatmeal with her spoon, blue eyes cast down in it, small dark circles under her eyes.  
"Gija?"

"..." no response just more stirring motions from her. Gija is kinda short for a girl her age. She's only 8 but still is smaller then everyone with the exception of Marie. Besides having dark blue pretty eyes Gija has this mysterious cocoa colored skin unusual for anyone around here. Nala used to say she wasn't from the desert that Gija was from the beyond. At first I believed Nala and avoided Gija at all cost but soon after the accident we all got along well. Gija was the one to save us from the freakish desert fire one summer when one of the old caretakers had forgotten to put out the fire of the evening meals.

I cleared my throat. Watching as she still didn't look up. I titled my head frowning at the unusual attitude.  
"Gija!" I said louder this time. Cling... Her spoon clattered uselessly to the floor she looked up frightened.

"Gija what's up with you? You're all jumpy like the time mean ole Niara told us about the desert goblins."

Gija looked at me for a long moment brow furrowed unsmiling, "I'm not scared!" she said defensively.

I just stared at her, looking for a way in. Gija can be very good at hiding things and lying but I've become pretty good at spotting when she's doing em.

"Gija...You don't have to hide no one's here ..." I murmured softly now looking down at my white bowl of mush and picking up my spoon half heartedly almost meekly.

Gija didn't' answer right away she looked around carefully then leaned forward, "Alley?"

"Hmm?" I mused softly not wanting to pressure her.

"Do you know about the time I told you about those...," she hesitated, " men that rode on horses as dark as night?"

"Yeah just when Nala disappeared..." I remarked casually attempting to remain composed and not quiver. Her details had been so vivid and Nala's disappearance wasn't easily forgotten.

She leaned forward grasping my arm, I gasped at how cold her fingers were.

"They're coming tonight." She whispered eyes wide with fear.

I stared at her my brown eyes mirroring my confusion and doubt.

She gripped my arm with her icy fingers shaking me once more, "Alley? Alley don't you understand? Alley?!" she whispered furiously nearly in hysterics.

"Gija... That can't be... There aren't any dark riders... They're can't be...That's a story... Stop it..." I stammered fear starting up my spine raking its frigid fingers across my minds vivid imagination.

"Alley please listen!" she pleaded tears welling in her crystal clear eyes.

"Stop it... Stop it... STOP IT!" I screamed horror and fear all welling at once crashing on me like the cool desert air at twilight.

"Alley..." She sobbed her tiny fingers wrapping around my wrist as if reassuring herself I was here with her.

"Alley ... Alley..." she blubbered tears streaming down her face her figure quivering behind the thin cover of her dress., "Alley it's not a story... Please you must believe me!"

"I can't..." I said shaking my head my heart swelling aching under the horrible news she'd just spoken. ' _They can't be real... Nala's with her family...Right?'_ I thought my mind reeling doing flips and falling with my stomach. I glanced at the bowl of food off to the side the mushy white wavering before my eyes, I felt sick quickly losing my appetite.

The tiny fingers clenching at my wrist brought me back to Gija. Whose eyes were red and puffy from her tears her bottom lip quivered and her whole body seemed to tremble in some hazy panic.

"Shh... Shh," I hushed her as her sobs fell and she began murmuring without making sense again, "Gija hush. No one's coming to take us... Nala went home... She found her family. Home Gija! Home! No riders... No-" I cut off as I heard heavy footsteps suddenly approach us. Gija's hand curled tighter around my slim wrist.

"Namon." I whispered without looking behind me. Gija barely nodded confirming my guess.

I cleared my throat turning slowly, "Na-"

Whap! A harsh hand slapped my right cheek leaving a stinging imprint. I bit my tongue but my eyes welled with unshed tears. My hand automatically went up to nurse the wound.

"Shame on you Alley scaring Gija! I won't tolerate tall tales in this house! Do you understand?" Namon all but barked at me.

I nodded to stunned to say anything else. I had never been touched before. Never in that manner not since long ago when I got in a street fight with two rough girls in the market who were picking on Gija. Yes I got a bit beat up but I survived that's what mattered.

I hung my head shamefully hand still touching the stinging wound.  
I looked up shooting angry looks at Gija through my tears. She returned the gaze with a sad almost apologetic look. I wrenched my hand from her curled fingers and ran to the door.

"Alley?" Namon's voice questioned seeing my actions.

I didn't need to turn to see the look on her face undoubtedly angry , "Where are you going?"

I didn't respond I ran for the door like it was an escape. I nearly tore the brass handle from its place with my clumsy hands as I stumbled out the door and into the harsh light of the sun and the hot wind which enveloped around me. I turned glancing back only once into the shadowed interior of the orphanage the only home I'd ever known at the two people who were my pillars in this vast desert and this small town. I looked back and the last tear rolled down my cheek as I fled into the town. For although it was small compared to others it had many sanctuaries. 

A/N: Aya nothing much more to say besides hope you enjoy and leave a review! Thankies so much for reading:star:
