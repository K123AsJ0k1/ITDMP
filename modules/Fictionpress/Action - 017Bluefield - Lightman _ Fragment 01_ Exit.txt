My story doesn't start with a dream, because it felt—no, it _was_ very real.

I remember being in this circular chamber, about one kilometer in diameter. The place itself seemed almost holographic, as if it didn't actually exist. The only thing that seemed concrete was the color of the room—metal grey—and a pillar-like computer terminal in the center of the room.

It definitely wasn't the newest PlayStation, but it was too…I dunno, _futuristic_ to be a relic, either. For one thing, it was huge, about as wide as a bus, and completely jet-black. I could see a computer display, but it was blank, and there was no visible keyboard or mouse. Plus, the terminal had this war-like design inscribed above the monitor—and it was pulsating with light.

The graphic showed a group of humans in modern clothing—young men in T-shirts, cargo pants or jeans; teenage girls in casual blouses and shorts. Both genders had on jackets and street shoes. Some of them were wearing headsets and earbuds. All were armed with a mix of weapons you'd see in a JRPG—swords and rifles, knives and firearms, hammers and rockets. It wasn't a battle amongst themselves—they were all charging at two separate groups of enemies.

The group on the left was made up of what looked like humans with large dove wings, each with a blank, mask-like look on their faces. They were armed with lances that seemed to give off a celestial—yet sinister—radiance. There was a bit of binary code below that part of the graphic, glowing in white: **01000001 01001110 01000111 01000101 01001100 01010011**.

The ones on the right consisted of shadowy humanoid forms carrying glaives and police batons. They were obviously the polar opposite of the left-hand group: they looked hostile, almost feral—an ugly combination of human cruelty and animalistic behavior. The binary underneath them pulsed a dark grey: **01000100 01000101 01001101 01001111 01001110 01010011**.

I returned my gaze to the center of the design, where the humans were, and looked at the binary code underneath: **01001000 01010101 01001101 01000001 01001110 01010011**.

I swallowed. I didn't know why, but the computer was really beginning to creep me out. Questions were rushing through my head: _what is this place? What's with this computer? What sort of design is that?_

Unfortunately, I didn't have any answers. Then a voice at the back of my head said: _Get away from that thing!_

Yeah. Great advice—except that my body began to move on its own. _Towards_ the machine.

As my body walked forward, I felt my hand go into my pants pocket and take out some kind of disc-like…computer chip, I guess, on account of the glowing red lines I saw across its surface. I looked back at the terminal—I saw a disc-shaped recess below the monitor. I didn't need to be an Einstein to figure out what-goes-where, or that whatever would happen if "I" put the disc in couldn't be good at all.

 _Dammit,_ I thought, _I've gotta stop myself!_

And just like that, I started to experience some sort of vertigo. I'm still not really sure what it was, or what caused it. All I do know is that it was enough to put me back in control of my body, (accidentally) drop the disc, and fall to the floor with a painful _THUD_.

I got to my feet, groaning and clutching my head. "Agh," I muttered out loud, "that smarts…"

Suddenly, a very loud, almost inhuman voice nearly made me jump out of my skin.

 **"PERSONEL _ONLY!_ DIDN'T YOU READ THE _SIGN?!_ "**

(For the record, I don't remember seeing a sign before finding myself here.)

I spun around, the terminal now behind me.

At the edge of the white room, I saw something that I immediately recognized from the graphic: some kind of "shadow creature". I couldn't exactly look at it head-on. Clouds of darkness emanated from its form, making it look like a silhouette with few details. What I could make out was that it had a thick police baton in its hands, and a mad grin plastered across its mouth.

It was like a scene from a thousand horrific nightmares. The problem: I was awake.

The shadow charged at me, baton raised high, prepared to smash me into a grease spot.

I did what came natural to me: I dodged to my right, avoiding the blow. There was a loud _THUD!_ , and I looked up to see the monster stumbling back from the large computer. I realized what had happened: the shadow couldn't stop its charge and struck the black device, which had amazingly taken no damage at all. The bastard regained its balance and turned towards me.

 **"DAMAGE TO SCHOOL PROPERTY,"** it roared again, **"WILL _NOT_ BE… _TOLERATED!_ "**

"No yelling in the library," I muttered.

The shadow raised its baton again and charged, but I was ready for it this time. As his weapon came down at me in a deadly arc, I swung my hand towards his wrist and grabbed it. Then, using the energy from his swing, I flung the bastard toward the opposite wall with a very loud _CRACK!_ The second that happened, its form dissipated into a trail of black clouds, which quickly vanished.

I breathed a sigh of relief and sat down on the floor. I was alive, and more importantly, the shadow that had tried to kill me was gone.

I looked around the room, looking at the red disc I'd dropped earlier. It was now broken, thin pieces of dark material spread out like a now-worthless jigsaw puzzle. I wondered why I had that thing, why I was in this place, and what that… _thing_ that attacked me was.

Suddenly, I heard two voices in my right ear—one a young female, the other an older male.

"Hey, I told you it wouldn't work," said the female voice, "but you didn't wait for me to finish, so don't blame me."

"Never mind that," the male voice snapped. "One of _them_ appeared! _Them!_ It's like losing your wallet and finding a fortune! Makes waiting almost bearable!"

 _Huh?_ I thought. _Why does that voice sound familiar?_

"Anyway, we have to get Jack out of there. We're close to losing him."

"Huh…?" A short pause, then I heard the guy curse. "Dammit! The H.S. field's failing! He's stabilizing in there!"

"We have to pull him out! _Now!_ "

"Fine!" Then, all of a sudden, the male voice started to address _me_. "Okay, Jack, stay calm. We're going to try and pull you out of there right now."

And with that, the voice went quiet.

I went for my right ear and pulled off a small grey headset. It looked ordinary enough to use for hands-free calling, but what caught my eye was a logo printed in black on the surface of the device:

 ** _NL_**

Before I could do anything else, this…thick fog started surrounding me. The cloudy mass became thicker and brighter, until I couldn't see the room anymore. Then—
