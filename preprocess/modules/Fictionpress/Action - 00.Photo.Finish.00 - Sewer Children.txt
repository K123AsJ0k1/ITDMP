	1. Chapter 1

**Summary:** The whole world was in chaos. It was everyone against everyone. With the exception of the Resistance, the children who occupy the Sewers, planning the downfall of the power-crazy dictator that had caused this modern apocalypse.

 **Rated:** T

 **Note:** Sewer Children, an idea that popped into my head when I was in the shower. Lol. Constructive criticism is welcomed, anything to up my writing skills. Not to mean though please? ^v^ And I'm winging the story a bit, just making up the scenes and characters as I go along. I got the main plot in my head though...

" _Shhh!_ " A smirk fought its way onto the boy's face as he pulled his hoodie tighter onto his head, trying to keep down his unruly light brown hair. The mask covering his mouth and nose itched a bit, but he paid it no attention. His coal-black eyes glistened as he lightly shoved the two other smaller figures with liquid gray-gold eyes in front of him in an attempt to get closer to the target. The two figures responded by jumping on him and blocking his airway. " _MPH-_ " The other companion ripped the two smaller ones off the boy and glared at the three with hard hazel eyes.

They all immediately backed down.

Giving the boy one last shove, the two smaller ones with identical mischievous eyes giggled silently as they scurried up the narrow trail. The boy with coal-black eyes glared after them. The hazel eyed one rolls his eyes and rushes forward, leaving the boy to trail after.

The boy slouched slightly, but slinked after them grudgingly. There was mission to complete and he could deal with the brats later.

 **:: SEWER :: CHILDREN ::**

 _K_ _ill. Apprehend. Boom._

The simple plan had made presented itself in the boy's mind as he watched the two smaller figures stalk around the room in scary synchronized steps and habits, killing off each other their designated guards in swift and quiet movements. They were perfect at this.

Then the other boy popped out from the ceiling, the hoodie fallen off due to him being upside down revealing mussy brown hair. He was done with his part, the bomb had been successfully planted onto the ceiling, ready to blow when the button in the pocket of the upside down male was pushed. The two other smaller ones had finished their dirty work, now almost done with their own bomb, a glint in their eyes as if ready to blow the warehouse up in a moments notice.

The coal-eyed boy then directed his attention a few feet away from the smaller figures section, concealed behind the giant boards and fallen bricks. Three men, all armed, each big, guarding the place his own bomb was to be placed. Time to set the final step in motion.

As quiet as the two other figures were, the boy slunk in the shadows, careful to avoid the guards watchful eyes, cautious as to anything that could endanger the mission. He reached the first man, he was strayed from the two others, near a rack that was sturdy enough to hold the boy. The boy wiggled slightly to get closer to the guard, sticking his hand inside his hoodie pocket before taking out a simple pocket knife.

" _To the neck. Silent, blissful, quick, and easy._ " In one fluid motion, the knife had sliced down onto the unsuspecting guards neck, blood gushed from the slice and trailed down his neck in sick bubbles, then he fell, dead in a moment. The boy caught him before his body could make an impact on to floor. Carefully, he placed him against the rack, closing his eyes and into the shadows so the others wouldn't see the blood from their distance.

Now for the final kills. Waiting for the right moment, just as the other guards had turned from each other for a split moment, the boy pounced on the first one, all thoughts of hiding gone as he stabbed his throat. The second one turned around in panic at the ripping noise of flesh, but just as he saw the boy, he himself was hit in the neck with three poisonous darts, killing him instantly as he fell to the floor next to the other one.

The boy coughed, pushing the body off of him and wiping the blood around his once all black hoodie.

"Impressive." Two voices giggled in unison, one slightly higher than the other. From the shadows came his three other companions, the two smaller ones, twins, had finally taken off their lower masks and hoodies, revealing two near identical faces, the one on the right's features softer than the others, and her eyes a bit wider, and lashes longer. Light brown hair with some sort of red tint in it made itself clear as both hairstyles spread around, the girl's slightly longer and neater but not by much.

The hazel eyed one was behind them, his mask also off, his hoodie forgotten, messy brown hair spread askew and carelessly, traces of dirt in them. All three has some blood stains, on their once black clothing, the twins having bandages around their faces due to past carelessness that they could have easily avoided but didn't. While the tallest one of the four had dirt and dried blood on his.

The boy grinned, finally revealed after taking off his own mask. Hoodie now off, his hair even unrulier than the other boy's spiked up and spread out. His own face held bandages, and there was a small scar embedded near his left eyebrow.

"Hurry and place the last bomb Zach. We have to return to the Sewer's soon." The twins pouted as Zach shrugged and got to work. "That's no fun Rei." They whined. "Quit spewing shit in unison you brats." Zach mutters as he finishes the wires. "Fuck you!" They yell back at the coal-eyed boy, making rather rude gestures with their hands towards him.

"Hush A and B," Rei sighs at the twins, Alpha and Beta just to tell you by the way. "You three give me migraines."

The rude gesture was then pointed at Rei.

 **:: SEWER :: CHILDREN ::**

Boom.

Alpha and Beta, A and B for short, watched with unnatural excitement as the warehouse blew into tiny little bits. A, the boy, smirked maliciously, licking his lips and itching to blow another thing up, while B, the girl, rubbed her hands in anticipation, ready to go old school and light a stick of dynamite if she had to.

Zach and Rei watched with ill-disgusted curiosity as the twins burst into a fit of disturbing giggles and hysteria at the explosion. The twins were never really right, they were born for this organization. They specialized in every sector. Engineering, spying, assassinations, _search and destroy_. The rest of the organization wonders whether to be worried or relaxed, as the twins have no problem of claiming lives, but they were merely 9 years old. The kids in the resistance all had that choice, to be one of them and to kill to get to the peace, or to just cower and sit back as the world spirals into chaos.

The twins had no problem at all. And to top it all off, they still acted as mere children anyways, wearing the same clothing just see if people noticed, talking in unison, finishing each others sentences, pulling pranks, and picking playful fights and banter with the other children. But the twins were weird.

Everybody chose to leave it alone.

Zach on the other hand, had to join the resistance as he had nothing left. His family left him in favour of the ever-rising dictator, and he refused to be just another child he could kick to the curb. He wanted to do something about it. He wanted peace. Zach was always an ill-tempered boy though. His temper could get ignited by the tiniest of things. He was 12, still pretty young. He had only been in the organization for 2 years, while A and B had been in since they were practically born, and Rei had been in it for 6 years.

Despite his that, Zach actually had a problem with killing people. He wasn't sadistic in any way, and can prove to show mercy on people. But throughout 2 years of it, he had learned to deeply conceal his scared nature. He had an enormous amount of determination and loyalty, willing to look past his fear of death to avenge himself and at least try to restore the world to what it had originally been.

Rei although, was an entirely different story. He had shown up in the Sewers scratched and bleeding half to death. The Nurses immediately went to work but he had permanently damaged his lung, which had been pierced by an arrow. If he hadn't stumbled into the Sewer's, he could have easily died at the age of 7. Before then, he was a cowardly boy. He couldn't, wouldn't stand up for himself. And when the dictator had sent men to massacre his family, he ran.

He got away with severe injuries, barely alive. But worse was the guilt of leaving his family behind to protect pathetic old him. Once healed, and given the opportunity to join the resistance family, he vowed to himself that he would protect this new family. He will fight, no matter the cost. He abandoned his sickly, cowardly nature, and became the stoic, cold, strategic 13-year-old he is today.

In any case, despite each and every vast difference, these four, along with all the other Sewer Children, have one goal in common. To achieve world peace, and to take down Dictator Alva Wilson.

 **Like? No? Review? Please? To keep in mind, this might be an overused idea, but I'm trying to twist it into my own image. I mean, an apocalyptic world where there's an illegal resistance of children who confide in the sewers. Who wouldn't love it?!**

 **Lol no. Please review though, they make my day!**


	2. Chapter 2

**Summary:** The whole world was in chaos. It was everyone against everyone. With the exception of the Resistance, the children who occupy the Sewers, planning the downfall of the power-crazy dictator that had caused this modern apocalypse.

 **Rated:** T

 **Note:** Idea's , idea's! ERMERGERD IDEAS! Thanks to a my first reviewers advice, multiple ideas hit me at once. And see! Criticism is allowed! Only if it's constructive!

"Gross!" Zach yells as decayed skull rolls in front of him as him and the three others went sauntering down the messy, abandoned alleyways of what used to be London. The twins scoffed as they both jumped onto the 12-year-old, "Grow up _Zachary_!" They mocked, giggling. "GEROFFME!" Zach seethes.

"All three of you shut you traps! Your going to risk us getting caught by Wilson's men." Rei whispers harshly, pushing them forward and kicking the skull away. "C'mon Rei, we're here already anyways!" Alpha says, ducking underneath Zach as the boy tries to claw off his younger twin sister. "Yeah seriously!" Beta agree's, yelping slightly when Zach finally manages to throw her off. She lands on Alpha, who trips Zach in the process, resulting in all three of them crashing into a pile of boards and through a hidden entrance.

Rei facepalms and follows them down, fixing the boards to conceal the entrance along the way. Now inside the abandoned building, which was rotting and smelled of decay and metallic blood, Rei found his three companions wrestling on the floor, he pulls the twins away from Zach just before Beta could land a kick on Zach's eye.

"Let's go you brats, the quicker we're back at the Sewer's the quicker you three can mess around." Rei hisses, growing even more agitated at their childish personalities.

Muttering curses under their breaths, they grudgingly followed his orders, stalking after him as he went into the corner of the building, kicking a pile of wood away, revealing a sewer pothole, an entrance to the Sewer. Zach scoffs to himself, what kind of design plan would have a sewer pothole inside a bloody building, he didn't know.

Rei bends down, fishing a screw from inside his hoodie pocket, unscrewing the entrance and carefully flipping the top off. A rancid oder immediately clogged all four of the children's nostrils.

"Ugh." Zach mutters, "2 years and still not used to it."

"Try being born in there you arse," The twins scoff, jumping in first, not even bothering to use the ladder as they landed with agile reflexes, rushing away on there own, towards where the resistance base was located.

"Tch, you weren't really born in the Sewer's you brats." Zach says bitterly to himself, Rei shakes his head and slides down into the Sewer himself, once again leaving Zach to follow.

 **:: SEWER :: CHILDREN ::**

"YOU TWO! QUIT PLAYING!" The first things both Zach and Rei witness after passing the Resistance guards where Alpha and Beta zooming past them, giggling as they dragged a sack of something through the Sewer room. Shutting the modeled gate closed from the room discovered by the start of the organization, Zach raises an eyebrow as Rei slinks away to seek the head of the resistance. The room was really just more than a lounge, there was a carpet spread all around the floor, various stolen furniture around it, including a television.

There were three levels, all opened ledges, all having ladders leading to them. The first level, expanded, thanks to the engineers, were where strategies are planned, where the different sections are. The missions on a large board that covered the entire wall. The different rooms labeled, 'search and destroy', 'assassinations', 'spies', etc. The second level was weapons, plain and simple. The simple necessities also, the makeshift kitchen, the hospital, and the enginering. The third level were the rooms, they were all mostly crammed due to the amount of children in the resistance. Sharing rooms with your original teams.

There were other Sewer rooms around the Sewers in London, this was just the biggest. Just to inform you.

 _Ahem._

Zach watched as A and B raced up to the second level, the girl with dark brown eyes at their heels. Molly, the head 15-year-old nurse and a bit of a prat. She was the sister of the resistance, and she didn't like to get out in the field like the other children. Her brown hair was almost always in a bun, although her signature satchel was missing. "Must have been what the twins were carrying." Zach mused to himself. " _Maybe I should join them..._ "

He couldn't though, because then he spotted Rei walking towards him with her. The brown-eyed, red-haired resistance leader, 17-year-old Bella. She was more than serious, she looked out for each and every one of the resistance children with an iron fist and a cold gaze. Her and Molly had lost their parents at a young age at the hands of Wilson. She was born 3 years into the apocalypse, in the year 2015. The Wilson reign had started in the year 2012 itself, 12-21-2012 to be exact. When she was 5 years old, her parents were killed directly in front of her. Wilson himself had personally shot them in front of the toddler sisters.

Orphaned, sick, tired, seeking vengeance, at the age of 7, Bella was molded into a cold, logical child in order to protect herself and Molly. Getting the idea of the resistance when she saw a group of loyal teenagers fighting off some of Wilson's guards, none fled in fear of danger, having each others back even when 3 fell.

The resistance had been on at 2013 already, though it wasn't a wide ranged one. It wasn't clarified. When Bella came and took control, collected recruits, the organization had been thriving for 10 years because of her.

Zach shivered slightly when Bella's cold brown eyes landed on him briefly, before she caught sight of Molly chasing after Alpha and Beta up on the 2nd floor already. Nodding at Rei, she slipped away to handle Molly's situation.

"Geez, her eyes give me the creeps." Zach says. "They're so _empty_..." Rei didn't answer, instead punching him in the gut before heading towards A and B who were currently rolling in the floor in pain because Bella had came up and whacked them over the head and tossing Molly back her satchel.

Zach watches as Rei scolds the twins, lifting them both up easily, despite their protests, and dragging them up into their room on the third level. Zach snickers as he scurries up after them. He was tired anyway, might as well get some sleep.

 **:: SEWER :: CHILDREN ::**

The girl with dark blue eyes watches Zach as he saunters into his and his team's designated room. She peeks in slightly to see their room as messy as always, the three beds pushed up against the walls. It was really four beds actually, the twins had pushed theirs together. Because they were always together. The girl didn't really like the twins, they were childish and immature. Not fit for their top rank in Search and Destroy. He didn't like Rei or Zack any better, because they had taken her spot on the top rank of teams.

"I know you're there Alice." Rei says as Zach jumps onto the bed with the twins and gave the two noogies. Alice huffs as she tucks a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear, the freckles on her nose turning red as her whole face slowly blushes at being caught.

"Still looking out for these immature brats are you Rei?" Alice said hauntingly. "Bitch." The three 'brats', A, B, and Zach mutter, as the twins adjusted themselves in Zach's grip. "Really Alice, still bitter about your team's ranking?" Rei sighs, fishing out some bandages from the drawer in the corner.

Alice's face turns red again as she lifts her chin. "Everybody knows my team and I are the best! Bella just favours your lot!"

The twins roll their eyes and Zach scoffs. Rei gives them a pointed look, always the polite one. "Alice I'm sure your team is very talented in the field."

"Don't flatter them big-brother!" Alpha and Beta say, using their nickname for the 13-year-old. I assure you they are not blood-related. "Jack and Karson are legit but she's just a big jacka-" The look Rei gave them was enough to shut them up. "You don't have to be so nice to her Rei, geez..." Zach says, rolling his eyes.

"Alice, please we're tired from our mission today." Rei says, "And I have to go down into the kitchen to get the twins something to eat before they wake Zach and I at night again because they wanted some chocolate."

Alpha and Beta snickered, they wanted chocolate. What of it?

Alice snorts, "Your not making me leave." Rei sighs yet again, before looking at his teammates on the bed. They look back at him in puzzlement for a moment, before realization dawned and they jumped off the bed and out the door. Alice's eyebrows furrow in question. "What are they-"

The twins and Zach come back in dragging a boy and a girl, the twins dragging the girl with the same dark blue eyes as Alice, but instead has brown hair instead of blonde, by the hand, and Zach more than just shoving the fraile-looking, sandy-haired, green-eyed boy inside.

"Tell her to leave big brother and big sister!" The twins whine, their voices changing into that of an innocent. "Big sister why are you in here bothering them?" The little 10-year-old, Jack, says to his 14-year-old sister, while Karson gives her fraternal twin a disapproving look.

"Well, they've got to stop acting so high and mighty when they clearly don't deserve their top rank!" Alice sniffs, on the verge of a tantrum.

"Since when do we-" Alpha starts, "-act all high and mighty?" Beta finishes. The two then snorted in unison, rolling their eyes. "Besides, the 'ranks' are just something the others made up." Rei sighs. "Seriously, what does it matter what rank anyone is in when we're all pinning after the same goal?"

"Ranking does matter! It does-" Alice was cut off when Karson clamps her mouth shut and laughs nervously. "I'm so sorry about her again..." She says, shaking her head. "We dunno where she gets it." Jack shrugs, as the twins giggle and prance around him. "Goodnight!" Both Karson and Jack say, before dragging out Alice who was "MPHH"ing and squirming.

The four watch them leave with blank expressions, before Zach breaks the silence. "They're a weird bunch."

* * *

 **Better? No I think it's worse. I gotta work on my describing skills...**

 **Anyways, any nice critiques? I tried to explain the setting more so in this chapter, and introduced another pile of characters that had popped into my head. Yeah, they live in London... at least what used to be London.**

 **See what I did there by the way? 12-21-2012? When the world was goanna end? Lol no. Okay.**

 **Please leave a review or a fave! It don't take that long! Please?**
