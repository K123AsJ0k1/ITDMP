Summary: Legends aren't supposed to be true, they're supposed to be fiction, pure imagination - lies. That isn't so for a community who lived just outside a forest that had been the soul of fictious stories. A community who are about to face their worst nightmare.





	1. Flash Burn

**FOLKLORE**

" _ **In legends, anything is possible…"**_

 **Chapter One**

 _Flash Burn_

It was dense within the forest that night and inside the humidity levels were beyond phenomenal. Not even the native animals that had lived there almost all their lives wanted to dare creep out into the abnormal hazy heat. The humidity alone could scare off even the sturdiest of kings.

The atmosphere inside the forest could resemble that of a desert at day – hence the wet heat and spontaneous sandstorms. They both held the legendary signature "trap of death" within their grasp – and still holding tightly.

The tall, looming trees that usually towered over the animal-worn pathways, providing shade for those who were trapped outside, were unusually thick with moisture, adding to the sticky, overpowering heat. The broad leaves that lay underneath the canopy top were oozing out its own food and some sort of wet substance, in attempts to rid the forest of its suffocating sickness of warmth. Even the animals, again, sensed that something was _very_ wrong. That something was changing. That something was _happening…._

A family of tigers had made their way up a large, broad tree, in attempts to seek shelter from the trap below them. They had already abandoned their home, burrowed deep, just below the tree. The higher one goes, the cooler it gets, as the birds sought refuge there, so did the rest of the animals – the ones who could climb, the rest? They sought sanctuary within the ground themselves, in hopes of waiting out the heat – inside it.

The family was already half-starved, and on the brink of thirst deprivation, and eventually leading into death. The alpha male of the group stood tall and erect, awaiting and protecting his family and children from any physical danger. For hours it had not moved, not even when its children started biting his tail. Then, after hours of waiting, it cocked its head, its ears suddenly twitching here and there as if to pinpoint a noise it had heard that was not from the forest. The male's entire back hair stood static and rough. It sensed danger, and its family knew it. The cubs started to whimper, but were silenced by the low, threatening growl of their mother, who had stood to stand by the father – for support.

A loud, deafening noise rocketed throughout the forest, practically shaking the leaves of the trees, and the bark of their wood. The bushes of the forest were quaking in their place, and a loud thundering roar erupted from the north, where the mountains were placed. The tigers growled and whimpered in fright. This was not normal in their world. This wasn't supposed to be possible. The 

mother almost lost balance on the tree but was saved only by her own claws. The father had one of his children clamped tightly in his jaws, by the back of its neck. The other child was to be held by its mother.

The proud family waited the abnormality out. If they could survive the heat, they could survive this. The roar lasted for many minutes, growing louder and louder each second. The birds had already risked the awaiting terrors outside, and had flown away. Animal whimpers and feral groans could be heard deep into the forest. The animals that thrived there could feel the vibration through the floor.

As suddenly as it came, the roaring stopped, the tremors ceased and the cries of the animals were silenced like a blade slicing through air. No matter how long the animals of the forest waited, nothing more could be heard coming out of the mountains. Nothing could be felt through the ground. The humid, sweat-drenching heat had disappeared as if it had never been there. No evidence could be found to prove that the events that just took place were not just a fragment of one's imagination.

Except one.

Just as the cubs of the proud family were about to jump off the tree and into the silent forest below them, naively thinking that everything was safe and everyone could come out, the quiet, menacing growl emanated once more from the male. It stood and sniffed the air, crouching low and pouncing off the tree and landing elegantly onto the forest floor. The male twisted around and walked north – towards the mountain and then stopped. All was peaceful, but no animals had dared to come out except him. The male could sense something else. Some thing was coming their way – and fast. Abruptly, the male pounced up, back onto the tree, and shielded its family from view. It looked down and scanned the forest floor intently for some unforeseen danger.

Just as the male was about to give up, its instincts gave it a split second to react before something – or someone – crashed through the bushes below them and run frantically through the forest floor. The figure ran with frightening speed, and after a few moments, it could be recognized as a human, or, something of it.

The figure was obviously male, but barely wore any clothing except around the waist in the form of shorts. The man was very muscular, with muscles rippling throughout his entire body from days of hard work. His body was littered with scars made from a smooth object, like a whip, and his hands looked rough from days of work with heavy tools. The man had very curly, dark brown hair, almost black from a distance, but in the light one could see the truth. He had a rough, chiseled face and a square chin with small cuts looked to be made from a sharp knife. He was tall, almost six foot four, nearly five, and he was wearing no shoes to protect his feet from the thorns that were scattered throughout the forest floor.

The man looked quite regular, maybe even handsome in other circumstances, until one saw his eyes. Once the alpha male saw the man's eyes, it was stricken with fear, and it was almost tempted to abandon his family and whimper. All thoughts of killing the man for food were banished out of the depths of its mind. The tiger was not stupid, it had seen a few others like him, but this was 

the first time it had seen its colour so pure, so clear, and so close up, as if it had been made from the gods themselves.

The man's eyes were _gold_. Not, brown, tarnished, or dulled, but pure gold.

This man was a Wereling.

Wereling's were creatures from legends that were not supposed to be true. They were only stories. An old wives tale told to scare the human children to not come into the woods at night, or day. Wereling's were beings who were supposed half human, half animal, but kept their human form. Evil creatures that roamed and terrorized freely in the night – and day. They were not restricted by law, or honor. The only law they lived by was to kill anything in sight – for food. The only way one could distinguish a Wereling from a human crowd was by its eyes.

Werelings however, were noble creatures. No matter how much one denied it, Werelings only killed if it had to, and it never killed a human unless necessary. Werelings have a superior intellect compared to most beings, and thrived on the concept of freedom. They despised the chains of rules, or a government who controlled everything they did. They despised the idea of being stuck in a room for more than an hour, for Werelings were free beings, but when angered, they were vicious animals. The Werelings hated to be found, they hated the invasion of privacy, and were as territorial as wolves and the cat kingdom put together. Wereling were rare creatures, and only fought fair fights. They only used their superior strength when necessary, but never stopped being alert. Werelings were renowned for their inability to be timorous or afraid. It was almost impossible to make a Wereling fearful, and when one was, one should be afraid too.

That is why the alpha male was terrified.

The Wereling looked as if he has seen a ghost, and was running away from it as if his life depended on it. From a distance, it seemed as if the figure was carrying a short sword, but if one could look closely, they would be able to see that it wasn't a short sword he was carrying, but a long, large, broad sword, with articulate, ancient carvings all along its blade, capable of slicing a broad tree in half with the right swing and strength. The carvings were in the form of symbols – ancient lettering that had not been seen for thousands of years.

On the man's right shoulder blade, a similar, ancient symbol appeared to be tattooed there. Except it was different than those that were engraved into the sword's blade, newer yet more elegant in such a way it looked like part of his body – a work of art. The tattoo looked to had been burned onto his skin; it was permanent and black as the depths of hell itself. The only traces of colour that could be found were blood red flicks on the ends of its points, as if the tattoo itself had been dripped in human blood before it had been burned onto ones skin. It edges blended into the man's skin, as if he had been born with it. There were no stretches, nor burn marks on the skin itself, it was flawless in every sense of the word.

Through feral instincts, initiated by the panic the sight of the strange Wereling, the alpha male leaped off the tree to the ground and chased after the man in full flight, leaving its family behind. To normal eyes, the tiger would only have been seen as just an orange blur of colour, blending into the woods. Only a flutter of leaves leaving the ground would have been left from its flight. The alpha male stalked the Wereling deep into the woods. Twisting and turning, lunging and 

hurdling itself onto the treetops or floor when necessary, it refused to be found. In any other circumstances, the Wereling would have already sensed that something was following him, but he was too busy focusing all his energy on running away from something behind him than look back and see his pursuer.

The alpha male tracked the Wereling deeper and deeper into the heart of the forest, into unfamiliar territory. It started to become uneasy with its surroundings. The trees began to steadily grow into wild and untamed clusters of leaves, vines, thorns, and bark. This was not its territory. Yet still it followed on, relentlessly. The Wereling lead the alpha male into the heart of the forest, where he dropped his sword and collapsed onto the forest floor, thick with dead, dried leaves and vines, under a large unfamiliar tree. The tree looked ancient, and had thick dark areas on its bark as if it had seen too many battles in its lifetime. The Wereling's breathing was shallow, and he looked to be too exhausted to even move, let alone breathe.

The alpha male stopped and waited in a distance. It surveyed its surroundings with caution, waiting for any threats to reveal itself. The tiger waited for many minutes, yet still it remained, uncaring and stoic. It lingered until it was dark to come out, when the man was sleeping peacefully. It sniffed its surrounding once more before carefully making its way toward the slumbering figure. The alpha male made sure to avoid the dry sticks and leaves that littered the floor stubbornly, but that proved to become impossible when it was nearer the Wereling.

The alpha male stopped, just outside the circle of dry sticks and leaves that surrounded the Wereling, and leaned in, carefully so not to disturb the resting male. It stopped just mere millimeters from the man's body and it opened its jaws slightly, as if to lick the man, to taste him, but instead, the alpha male inhaled the man's scent. Once it did, the tiger leaped back as if in shock and sneezed. The Wereling's scent was different somehow, different from the others. It was only a minor difference but it was enough for the tiger to really think hard. It was as if the Wereling had been touched by something divine, evil or not, he had an unusual aura around him.

Once again, the alpha male leaned it, but found that it could not reach the man. So it took a chance and stepped forward a little more. The male could not see the man's face, but instead his back. So it tilted its head lightly forward and nudged the man's shoulder blade.

His right shoulder blade.

Instantly, once the alpha male's wet nose unwittingly touched the dry skin of the man's tattoo, a blinding flash of white light materialized from his shoulder blade. It glowed and grew warmer, scaring the alpha male so much it scampered back to its hiding place a few yards away. It watched the man glow until its eyes hurt too much and tried to turn around and flee, but found that it could not. A magnetic pull tugged at the tiger's body, and it grew painful when the alpha male refused to move. Reluctantly, the male staggered towards the Wereling with sluggish movements, then stopped when it was almost on top of the man. The tiger once more nudged the man's body to wake him with its nose, but growled in pain when its forehead burned with a fury.

* * *

If anyone, ore anything, were to look and the scene unfolding in the heart of the forest, they would have seen that the same symbol on the man's shoulder blade was burning itself onto the alpha male's forehead. They would have heard the feral howls of all the animals of the forest, and 

the anguished roar of the male tiger. They would have seen the birds of the woods circle the two beings, and would have felt the violent tremors start once more.

They would have noticed the faint, ancient whisperings of an unknown language weave itself all throughout the wood, enticing any being within hearing distance.

But they would not have remembered, because just as the anguished roar of the alpha male silences, an explosion of light erupted from the two figures, burning everything it touched….

	2. Prophecy

Samantha BeaumontFolklore - English 9NC

 **Chapter One**

_Prophecy_

'" _Come on little one, it's not much further now" a tall female figure of a mother cooed to a small child in front of her. The child followed like a small dog on a leash, obedient and trusting, with wide eyes and a naïve smile. The boy had dark brown eyes, and very dark brown hair, and already at the age of nine, he was very tall, around five foot seven. There was still some baby fat on him, but it was blatantly obvious he was well built for a young boy. "You see little one? Just a little further" The mother figure said again, slightly tugging onto the little boys arm._

 _The duo arrived upon a large obelisk clad only in black marble, of a god punishing a bent, cowering male figure by a whip, where the mother figure called out a few words to the head of the god and moved on, where a large cathedral could be seen places at the foot of a large mountain. "Where are we going?" The little boy whispered to the motherly figure._

" _To a place where one can be washed of all sins" Said the motherly figure in a sing song voice, enticing the boy to move forward once again. Once the duo reached the large, menacing wood oak doors of the cathedral, a protesting groan could be heard emanating from the door itself. It was being opened, for the first time in a hundred years. Large packs of dust could be seen puffing out of small holes from the door, showering the pair in dirt and splinters._

 _A priest could be seen just behind the opening of the doors, beckoning them in. Hurriedly, the motherly figure ushered the little boy in, forcefully pushing the reluctant boy into the haunting cathedral. Immediately, the doors closed after the twosome, shutting them out from the world outside. Scared the boy jumped and turned around, but came face to face to the shut doors of the oak._

" _Come little boy, come with me to the chambers" a raspy voice hissed, coming from the ancient looking priest. With nowhere to go, scared out his mind, and with nothing to do, the boy halfheartedly followed the man into a dark chamber, leaving the female figure behind, where a circle of elders awaited him. As the boy entered the room, he was roughly pushed into the middle of the circle, and because of the unexpectedness of the movement, the boy tripped up over his feet and landed flat on his face. Unimpressed, the priest spat, "This is the boy? Are you sure?"_

" _Yes we are sure" The elders spoke in unison, with a sense of authority in their voice, "Would you dare oppose the order?" The priest shook his head, and was ordered to leave. At once, when the priest left the room, all heads slowly turned to observe the boy who was just picking himself off the floor._

" _What am I doing here?" The boy shakily asked, trying to put on a brave face, "Why am I here? What have I done? What will you do to me?!" With each word the boy spoke, his voice grew louder and louder, until he was close to screaming. A flash of pure gold flickered deep in the depths of the boy's eyes. The elders had not missed this, and turned to meet each other's gaze approvingly, before turning back to the quickly raging boy._

" _You have been chosen" the voices said, coming from places all around, surrounding the boy helpless, "to become the most powerful being on earth" The voices paused slightly to let this sink in before starting again, "you will have a companion, and many will know you, and who you are, they will not know your history, or deeds, but instead know you for the stories the bards sing about you, you will become a legend, a myth, a story, to see you will be rare, because of your abilities…"_

" _What if I don't want this?" The boy screamed in grief, his eyes blazing, and the flickers of gold appearing more frequently than it was supposed to, unaware of the slight burning sensation lining itself on his back._

" _You have no choice!" The elders screeched, "One must take the fall, and you have been chosen…" The elders stopped when they looked back at the boy, or more importantly, his eyes, they were pure gold, not the tarnished dull that they expected, but pure gold, their heartless, emotionless eyes watching him wearily, until one of let saw the symbol on his back._

" _What is this blasphemy?!" An elder cried on his own, breaking the bond the elders had on the boy, this was not supposed to happen, only the almighty in lore could have those eyes, only the almighty could wear that symbol. Instantly, the boy's eyes unfocused the boy gave out an inhuman growl. He hunched down as if to attack, but instead screamed and collapsed onto the floor, writhing in agony. Pain was coursing throughout his body, he could feel the burning touches of flames, licking at his back._

 _With one last scream in agony, the boy snarled with a voice, not his own, in a language only the elders could understand and with that, all that could be heard within the halls of the cathedral were screams of pain and fury…._

Leo l'Onnipotente woke up in a large oval like clearing, drenched in his own cold sweat, his breathing shallow and his back to the floor of the forest, with slicks poking at his back savagely. Uncaringly, Leo didn't move but instead ignored the slight annoyance at his back and contemplated his dream like he had done for the past fifteen years, ignorant of the pleasant warm sensation on his right shoulder blade. The dream had been different, somehow more in-depth, informative and deep, like he was only the observer and not the victim. He has had that nightmare ever since he was a little boy, the dreams plaguing his mind relentlessly, mercilessly. With a grunt, Leo lifted himself up off the ground and glanced up at the sky.

And came face to face with pitch black darkness.

Startled, Leo tried to jump up, but found out he could not. He tried once more and instead he was met with painful protesting muscles and the slight crack of his bones. Wincing in pain, Leo lay his body back down onto the ground, gently so not to inflict more pain on himself, and pondered about the series of events that happened just a few hours ago. He thought of his past memories and dreams. He thought about his sword….

At that very thought, Leo's eyes widened slightly in fear and his hands immediately searching the ground frantically with a sickening dread slithering down his spine. That sword was _important_. It was not just some object of war, it was a sacred artifact, the only existing key of….

Leo leaped off the floor, completely ignoring the sudden ache in his bones and the protesting twinge in his muscles. He hunted for the mysterious sword hysterically, fearing the worst, and because of his oblivious search for his sword, Leo's obvious tunnel vision did not allow his to see the _very_ large alpha Bengal tiger that was sitting slightly to his left with a dangerous expression on its face, and strange eyes. So when Leo's foot came in contact with a solid, heavy object on the ground, it was so unexpected that the effect of the shock itself was enough for the Leo to fly over the object and into a very, _very_ soft object.

In short, Leo crashed into the one thing he did not want to see at all, a larger than average stoic, angry alpha tiger. Groaning in pain and shock, Leo didn't bother to move, thinking he was already dead anyway. He could use his heritage, but he hated it with a passion, and even if he did want to, he didn't think he could because his energy was so sucked dry he was surprised he was able to muster up enough energy to even open up his eyes, let alone get up and look around for his sword. Leo waited for what seemed like hours, until the figure underneath him growled at him. Surprised the he wasn't already a bloody shredded mess on the floor, Leo lifted his head to see the bright inquisitive eyes of the alpha, regarding him carefully before growling at him once more and easing itself from underneath him.

Leo almost asked the alpha what he was doing, but stopped. ' _It's just a Bengal'_ He thought _, no harm in ignoring it, if it won't kill me now, then it never will…_ but just as Leo thought it, he felt stupid. An animal of the forest was a friend of his, he was fairly sure that the Bengal could sense his heritage, but he never in a million years thought the tiger was intelligent enough for him to think that it already knew what Werelings were and who he was.

Tuning back to the tiger, Leo cautiously patted the matted orange fur of its back and turned to leave, but not before he stopped to pick up his sword from the ground. He lifted it from its hilt and inspected it. To the untrained eye, one would think that it was just an ordinary broad sword, new and unused, but that was not so, for the sword was centuries old, and had been wielded by many heroes, but not always for the right cause. The sword hadn't got a scratch on it, it was flawless to its core. The only piece of evidence that proved that it _had_ been used was the hilt itself, which was usually covered by its wielders hand, obscured from view.

The hilt was well worn a rugged, its once bright and proud colours that usually caught the eye of anyone in sight were dulled and ripped. Several patches and repairs had been made to try and replenish the history it held, but none were successful for a long period of time. The sword had seen many battles in its lifetime, and had seen very few peaceful ones.

Leo was distracted from his observations when he felt a slight brush of bristly fur against his leg. Immediately, Leo leaped back and pointed his sword to the ground, then almost dropped it when he saw where he actually was.

He was in a massive circular clearing. The bark on the trees had been ripped off the main body, and the twigs and leaves on the floor and trees itself were nowhere in sight. It was just a huge, wiped out circle, in the heart of the forest. Leo did not remember this, but he made no move to find out what caused this, because he was no longer taking in his surroundings, he was staring into the tigers eyes.

The Wereling could see a story in the alpha's eyes. Not one necessarily its own. The tiger was old for its age, and that explained why it was so large.

But then he saw something else. Something different. Something that shouldn't have been there, in its memory.

He saw his childhood.

He saw his mother there, playing with a child and embracing his father. He saw his first toy, his first pet, his first friend. He saw his fondest memory, of the time where his father took him to his first campfire trip and told him about all the folklore that he knew, about the Werelings and the animals of the forest, about the ancient battles that took place to acquire something so ancient and precious of the land that it required only bloodshed to obtain it.

More importantly, Leo saw his nightmares, nightmares he wished never to be unveiled again.

It suddenly clicked to Leo that this animal, that was sitting before him, proud and defiant of all rule, was no longer an animal that it used to be. He lifted his gaze slightly upward, and what he saw explained why it was no longer an animal, but a companion. Upon the alpha's forehead, there lay the same tattoo that burned its way onto his own back. Yes, the tattoo was smaller, and had a different colour, orange and black, to blend itself in, but it was still there, but instead of a burn, it looked to be the odd formation of fur that had somehow lined itself up to become an interesting pattern that resembles that of an ancient symbol not seen long ago.

Walking up to the alpha male once more, Leo remembered something in his nightmare that saddened him to his very core. ' _You have been chosen, to become the most powerful being on earth. You will have a companion, and many will know you, and who you are. They will not know your history, or deeds, but instead know you for the stories the bards sing about you. You will become a legend, a myth, a story, to see you will be rare, because of your abilities…'_ The tiger was his companion. Nothing else could have explained what happened to him. The prophecy had been completed. Once more a life of a vibrant soul had to be taken away to make him become what he so despised.

As a young boy, after he had heard the prophecy of what he had to become, he was vengeful. Night and day he planned to become a hero so powerful that nothing could stop him taking back what was once his. They slaughtered his family, and deposed of his friends, and threw him into a detention cell so he could not fulfill the premonition of the elders.

He was not detained for long, for Leo worked hard for year, working solely on his primal instincts to break him out of the cage the people confined him in. He broke out, and all hell broke loose, his community was different, they had abandoned the traditional occasions and religion and there were foreigners in his town.

Bloodshed was spilled that day, and what was left were the carcasses of the towns people piled up as a massive funeral pyre with the heads of the elders thrust upon poles, their heads severed from their spines by a sword not their own.

Stories were told of the monster that wreaked havoc in the most powerful community of all time. The bards who sung the tales foretold that it were to be the largest blasphemy that ended in bloodshed in history. Noble knights and wise sorcerers and hardened kings armies marched into the forest, seeking the monster who defied the elders and but the order in disarray.

They were to be found later, limb by limb torn of and in a pile waiting to be burned.

There was not a mark, scratch, or fiber that was left to give any evidence of who or what did this, but the armies and mercenaries that once steadily marched into the forest, seeking the gold, treasures, and the legendary monster waiting to be slain, steadily decreased until not a soul dared to venture out into the forest.

That monster was Leo l'Onnipotente, the troubled boy turned mad with grief.

Yes it is true that he did not mean to cause harm to those lives that got in his way, but he was wild and untamed, driven insane my the confinement half of his life and the haunted memories of his family and friends massacred in the name of the order.

Leo turned his attention back to the awaiting alpha male that sat patiently before him. He smiled sadly and shook his head slightly, as if apologizing to the animal for the grief he had caused.

"I shall call you _Alpha_ for that is what you are, the first and the last of my companions" He whispered softly to the tiger, whilst patting the males head. "Let us go into the woods where no one can bother us no longer…"

And so the twosome set off into the forest, and out of the clearing, its presence only a reminder of the arrival of l'Onnipotente, and what he took and left behind.

Yes, after years of confinement-induced insanity, being stuck in the forest calmed the mind of Leo, restoring his mind and memories into order. Leo was forever remorseful for the lives he took, but the one thing he never regretted was destroying the order once and for all.

As Leo and the alpha male headed East, towards a city called Forcick, Leo pondered over his life, of the folklore tales his father used to talk about as a kid. He thought of the heroes of the tales, and the prophecies, that the stories contained. He wondered whether or not if the stories were true, or just fabricated stories that solely existed to entertain a child. But the only thing he did not have to think about was his story, for he was living it, he was living his own nightmare.

Not all legends are true, and when they are, not all of them end in a happily ever after.
